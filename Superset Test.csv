For example: 1. There is no option of Team up Mode in VIP Rooms. 2. During the game if you mute opponents then you won't listen to them but they can still listen your conversation. 3. There is no private chat option in the game. 4. Numbers distribution in the game is not balance. Sometimes you get the same numbers repeatedly 3 to 5 times and very often you don't get specific number in 20 to 25 turns. This is very strange. 5. To be continued..

It may be finished immediately. Secondly in tournaments the winner of final gets a lot of coins but for runner up there is nothing. It is totally unfair and disgusting. Both of these decreases the charm of the game. Lastly the graphics of the domino gameplay needs to be improved a lot. Having above drawbacks deserves only 2 stars.

And in chat there should be options to send voice notes and share files with each other. More on that there should be options to delete messages in chat.

I play with the same group of people usually and every time it's one of two people that get the exact same high numbers and they always win. It's not possible to get these numbers in real life consistently back to back to back. And you can predict when you will die  once the computer decides who will win  you will always get sent back home.

I never win hundred thousand coins shared match.). So I request that you should focus that point ‚òùüèø.

First  the game graphic causes permenat burn-in on my AMOLED Phone screens  and yes I've changed three Phones because of the deep colors used for the graphic design of the game. Second  Dice-roll and numbers to get isn't logical and fair at all. You SHOULD review Dice function and module for more accurate results  also to satisfy users. I wish to rate you 5 stars but actually couldn't.

It only gives privilege to those players who buy from their store. It doesn't matter how good you are playing and winning  at the end they will put you down to lose the game by killing same token several times so the privilege player can win. Very disappointed

Even then you will not be given the number and you will lose the game. This is very bad and that is why this game is not good. Do not play this game. üò°üò°üò°üò°
