Mini Metro,this is a review from a new player and i can already tell this is a great and very addictive game. i have only run into one issue thus far - it can be very hard to tell on my small phone screen if a line is attached to a shape or merely next to it. noticing this too late has caused most of my game overs so far. could we get clearer a visual indicator of unattached shapes? a dot in the middle? different color? idk but this would really help my experience. thanks!,LABEL_2,0.614187002,19-Nov-21,103,466,3.611650485,48
Mini Metro,"i knew the developers from the pc game mini motorways. i love that game and have over 10 hours put in on it and wanted to see if it was on mobile as it was a great way to pass time. it isn't, but i found this gem instead. it makes sense because this is clearly much simpler than motorways and is therefore better suited for mobile. i opened the app to check it out real quick and ended up playing an hour. oops. great game.",LABEL_2,0.94244945,1-Apr-23,95,423,3.557894737,44
Mini Metro,"by far the best sim game for android. not only does it provide unique and endless challenges it does so without forcing in-app purchases. theres also realistic goals to unlock different levels. theres also no limit on gameplay based on usage or time constraints as well as options for freeform gameplay without constraints of the normal gameplay, for example if a station overcrowds typically the game ends but not in freeform. most addictive and traditional simulation game ever for mobile.",LABEL_2,0.965892017,20-Jan-19,86,491,4.790697674,31
Mini Metro,"if you like mini motorways you will probably enjoy this. however i have to deduct two stars for two reasons. first is poor controls - it is very common to try to grab a line to extend it and end up moving a train. secondly is a glitch where an empty tram will pass by a full station. these are both really frustrating because it isn't your design that causes you to lose, it's poor game design. without those issues it'd be a 4-4.5 imo",LABEL_0,0.742338538,17-Aug-23,94,435,3.734042553,43

Dungeon Princess 3,"casual player of the first and second game. i love the gameplay especially the fast paced combos of the combat. i am not too fond of the grind. i think less required resource for anything would be better, but it is bearable. the worst part of all the games is the overpriced goods within the store. $60 for a monthly pack of 60 pulls and some cosmetic or pets is a robbery on the same level as other terrible gacha games. i have no respect for the dev.",LABEL_0,0.755119622,17-Jul-24,97,452,3.762886598,45

Dungeon Princess 3,note: have some way to get rid of the ai art i dont want to see that. plus its so in your face everywhere have the disable feature just remove all of it from all screens. but comparing it to the previous game dungeon princess 3 is ok to say the least. build variance and artifacts can really make all kinds of builds. the issue is how scummy the paid items are + how tedious the grind is to even get started on getting anything would prolly play the older games for now though.,LABEL_0,0.662895739,30-May-24,100,477,3.84,44
