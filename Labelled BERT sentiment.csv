Yalla Ludo - Ludo&Domino,It's a good game but it still need some improvements. For example: 1. There is no option of Team up Mode in VIP Rooms. 2. During the game if you mute opponents then you won't listen to them but they can still listen your conversation. 3. There is no private chat option in the game. 4. Numbers distribution in the game is not balance. Sometimes you get the same numbers repeatedly 3 to 5 times and very often you don't get specific number in 20 to 25 turns. This is very strange. 5.

Yalla Ludo - Ludo&Domino,The rules of ludo game needs to be modified as the the option of undo is totally unfair in gameplay. It may be finished immediately. Secondly in tournaments the winner of final gets a lot of coins but for runner up there is nothing. It is totally unfair and disgusting. Both of these decreases the charm of the game. Lastly the graphics of the domino gameplay needs to be improved a lot. Having above drawbacks deserves only 2 stars.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999676824,3-Sep-20

Yalla Ludo - Ludo&Domino,The dice roll algorithm for this game is absolute garbage. I play with the same group of people usually and every time it's one of two people that get the exact same high numbers and they always win.

Yalla Ludo - Ludo&Domino,The game is quite amazing but i don't like the changes which were made after the recent update. The way a player can double their tokens and can only move when an even no. comes... It creates a lot of mess and frustration among the other players as they can't move their tokens and are stuck behind that doubled token unless they get a rocket.

Bubble Rangers: Endless Runner,The Performance is terrible since the update. Before I could run 180 fps no issue now the game lags badly at 30 fps.

Bubble Rangers: Endless Runner,Recent updates have added another layer of difficulty. As you progress  the gameâs speed increases the difficulty  This results in quick deaths and can lead to a frustrating experience. While the concept of Bubble Runner is intriguing  the extreme difficulty and fast-paced progression might not appeal to everyone. It would be beneficial if future updates could balance the difficulty level ,NEGATIVE,1,0.999287307,11-Apr-24
Bubble Rangers: Endless Runner,Too hard with the recent update(it's now annoying) and it takes so much time to login. I spend minutes on logging screen  but it never logins. I have a good network  so don't say it's because of network. Just to emphasize one my first point  making the obstacles ridiculously close to each other  and making me fail with just one bump with an obstacle is obnoxious. Also  the character glitches and doesn't respond to my swipes. The game is bad and needs a lot of improvement.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999506831,21-Apr-24
Bubble Rangers: Endless Runner,The latest update feels a bit juvenile with the shields being too powerful  and the removal of the  Long  legendary skin from the magic wheel is disappointing  especially for players like me who were halfway to unlocking it. It would be great if the team could bring back the  Long  skin and perhaps offer players a choice between prioritizing it or the  Galaxy  skin. I really hope this feedback reaches the development team.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99948895,24-Apr-24
Bubble Rangers: Endless Runner,Honestly  this new update is the worst! When it's time to save my progress   it just keeps saying my Internet connection is poor while there's nothing wrong with my connection.

Bubble Rangers: Endless Runner,New update sucks. They include features no body asked for. Just like new shield fast travel feature which is useless. But they don't fix the freeze issues etc. Also they didn't even warn us that season is ending.

Bubble Rangers: Endless Runner,It's still ok I guess  but now it's like every typical game that's only much more fun and eaiser for those with money. Also  it has this bug where it lacks for a few seconds every now and then. A suggestion: if you'll have that many characters then at least make the characters have some special skills or something. If you play so hard to afford a character  then let it have a skill beyond a cute onesie.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998513401,11-Apr-24
Bubble Rangers: Endless Runner,The game play is really enjoyable but please do something about the shield. It shouldn't cease to be operational because of the wings for there are dark clouds/turbulence up there that one needs shielding from. That's why it's a shield  i guess. Just like the magnet doesn't cease operating when one picks up wings  so I hope the shield should be. Overall  the game is enjoyable.,POSITIVE,0,0.999521971,26-Apr-24
Bubble Rangers: Endless Runner,Hi developers... This my honest review of Bubble Rangers. First of all it's a very interesting game. At first I thought it will be just like Subway Surfers or Temple Run. It's somewhat similar to the previous games I mentioned but only in a few ways. The map selection is great  it changes automatically when you reach a certain point. Skins are awesome. Especially the feature of points booster percentage according to skin category. Overall it's more refreshing and interesting than it's rivals.,POSITIVE,0,0.999783218,19-Apr-24

Bubble Rangers: Endless Runner,It's a fun game but it has a stupid logic  comparing to subway surfer or temple run its nothing. As further you go   the idea  is that the game has to get harder  but instead it gets stupider. The glitches apear  the logic doesn't apply as it should. And in some cases the games not fair  there's a different between a hard game and an unfair game  why the way has to get blocked after you slide down of a block?

Bubble Rangers: Endless Runner,The new updates are harsh  you cannot last even for 5 minutes due to increse in difficulty and speed.

Ludo STAR,Update Version 1.89.3 is very slow ludo is a game played by two to four players. Each player must choose one of the four available colors to play as. The game starts with each player taking turns to roll the die. For a player to start moving a piece around the board  they must roll a six. Once you have multiple pieces in play  you can choose which piece you want to move.Ludo game is my favourite,POSITIVE,0,0.551356733,8-Sep-23
Ludo STAR,It can be really fun or it can be SUUUUPER frustrating. But it's enjoyable. However: program your bots better. Bots will eat their own teammates just to further themselves. I don't mind playing with or against bots  but at least make them less selfish teammates ð I have lost so many coins coz of me pressing 1 wrong button (private table instead of team up and then the coins are lost even though the game didn't even start. Also  the pop ups in the beginning are a bit too much...,NEGATIVE,1,0.991668344,29-Apr-24
Ludo STAR,The Algo is clearly unfair. It is not a game for strategical players. The game decides the winner before it is even started. I deleted this game last year and somehow kids installed it again.. Had a horrible experience last year and unfortunately doesn't change. Supports players with Hundreds and millions of gold coins A high category or ranking. Not sure if it has to do with the purchases? the player with more purchases probably has a better luck?,NEGATIVE,1,0.999700308,24-Apr-24
Ludo STAR,It's fun but some times 100% rigged. Some times I play against players that get the exact number needed to win through the whole game. Every dice roll is the perfect roll and the game ends so quickly i don't get a chance to do anything!! I have been on a loosing streak for years now it's like the game is refusing to let me win!! Really bad dice rolls and such things! Everybody saying the same thing but they insist that the game doesn't favor anyone.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99955672,22-Apr-24
Ludo STAR,This game is all good but I find something v annoying in this game that is  it doesn't give me the reward after watching several adds.. although it offers an add w an exchange of rewards...in this game the gem usage is also not too helpful at every move.. some of the matches offers others more chance to win rather than me when I already make it almost to home...idk what a drag happens.. anyway still I like to play this game in my boredom,NEGATIVE,1,0.999456227,26-Apr-24
Ludo STAR,It's pretty interesting  initially it will let you win almost every game. I won almost every game  then on purpose i wasted whatever gold i had  so that i can buy more gold.

Ludo STAR,It used to be my favourite game but I dont get the right numbers on time even there are 3 different opponents tokens front of me for me to kill but I dont get any required numbers. Moreover  I dont get 6's. I only get numbers as slow as snail such as 2  1  3  because of this I never get to reach on my home and get killed constantly. My opponents get the most favourable numbers on their turns. This is so very unfair game!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999406815,14-Apr-24
Ludo STAR,It was many times mentioned that those who put money in have better odds  but it gets much worse. The game's developers and support team lack respect for players and fail to address issues affecting gameplay. Attempts to use the  undo  feature are thwarted by a bug  and support offers no help despite evidence provided. Similarly  watching ads for rewards often yields no rewards  with support ignoring complaints. Engaging with this game is not recommended due to these deceptive practices.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999762833,6-Apr-24
Ludo STAR,I'm unable to open the app it always says something went wrong try login again and when I login it still won't open just a blank page. It's frustrating. I updated it in hope that it might be a glitch but it won't open if after the update and login.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999354064,20-Apr-24

Ludo STAR,Very Bad Game. I don't know what and how the Software Developers thought to design this game. The computer only gives favourable dice to the person who is already ahead in the game  and the opponent does not get any favourable dice at all to set moves. When you try to hold someone's last tokens they get unbelievable numbers of sixes and gets away easily. It seems that the Software pre-makes decision that who will win  and your moves and risks does not even count.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999789298,28-Mar-24
Ludo STAR,Very annoying game  very disappointing game Most of the time no matter how good your strategy is the game never lets you win  you are never going to get the numbers that you need  whereas your opponent gets all the right things happening at the right time. Extremely one sided. Which is frustrating. Not sure if it's a logic  algorithm  or bots playing on the other side,NEGATIVE,1,0.999474347,31-Jan-24
Ludo STAR,Very bad experience when playing with an opponent  the opponent gets 6s more often  the app developers are such a greedy they want us to make purchase of gems. While playing it gives so many times three 6s but when collecting dice it never gives three 6s because in lucky dice you will get 1000 gems in reward. I'm on this platform for about 6 years and never got three times 6s in lucky dice. Such a pathetic scripting of the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999315262,5-Apr-24
Ludo STAR,App has a serious problem when giving rewards after watching ads. It's very annoying watching an ad and then not receiving the shown reward.

Ludo STAR,Waste game... It's frustrating that this game is one-sided with Fixed algorithm which forces to be defeated all time.

Ludo STAR,The bond dice collection needs to be taken out as they are way to over powered. I play a private match with 2 other friends and they had the same dice and they were getting big numbers and I was not even able to get 2 sixes. They were both getting sixes after each other and they were losing to me then all of a sudden they both managed to kill all my dices which kind of mad the game unfair. I had an epic dice collection aswell but mine didn't manage to get any big number right till the end,NEGATIVE,1,0.999644756,24-Feb-24
Ludo STAR,Mechanics of this game is broken. Play this game more then 5 times and you will see a patten whereby one player gets 6s  double 6s every other turn and the other player is left with 1s and 2s. The dice roll in this game isn't 'luck'. It's mechanics and when one side gets a massive advantage this game becomes frustrating very fast. Then the inevitable uninstall.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998961568,25-Mar-24

Ludo STAR,Honestly the game is awful  most of the rewards aren't given to you after watching an ad  the dice rolls purposely rolls bad to make you spend the gems   something went wrong  with most of the ads and you can NEVER recover gems  they have you watch an ad and it constantly spins and never gives the gems back  pathetic game  pathetic company don't waste your time on this garbage,NEGATIVE,1,0.958116591,23-Feb-24
Ludo STAR,Worst game .... They promise u to guve reward after watching ads but they don't.... They just say Something went wrong....algo of the game is terrible to the extent it makes the game totally biased no matter how well and streategic u play . And after playing for about 6 months straight and there is no change in my opinion. M gonna delete this game and not gonna play ever in my life again. Very bad experience.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999715626,2-Mar-24
Ludo STAR,I play this game regularly  for many hours. I played it this afternoon last. Right now  I logged in  and the game started from scratch  although I had a lot of coins and gems.

Ludo STAR,So many Bugs  game developers are cheater  when you win 100K  they just add 40 50K all the time  instead of 100K  and when you loss they deduct correct amount.Thats ridiculous! And I had winninh streak of 6  its got vanished to 0.They made this game so that you can less coing for winning  so that you purchase coins.SCAN The players with highest levels  always have a unfair advantage,NEGATIVE,1,0.999103308,20-Feb-24
Ludo STAR,The dice is not random at all. It's came to a point where you can easily predict upcoming numbers and who is going to win the game.

Ludo STAR,What a game absolutely fantastic. I can't believe that such a game can be downgraded by the customer.if you are not willing to install it just because of the bad reviews  then definitely you are doing wrong.

Most of all I found my â¥ï¸here so definitely I prefer others to enjoy it,NEGATIVE,1,0.954881668,16-Mar-24
Ludo STAR,Am ratingit 1 star because whenever you have less coins and gems you will never have good numbers always 1 2 3.... But when opponent went inside home then you will have 6 6ðð that's not good ....

Ludo STAR,It's funny how gameberry labs is claiming that this game isn't biased when it clearly is. Seems quite idiotic but greedy that a company doesn't want to stand on business by actively choosing to play as cowards. Real simple: this game has incredible bias and a winner is determined as the game starts. The tragic part is gameberry thinks their clever by lying to their own player base. This is what gameberry is: shameful and pathetic.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996181726,2-Mar-24

Ludo STAR,you can improve it by playing fair game. The idea is to have fun not cheat your way through. Can't understand why winning through unfair playing is sÃ²Ã²oo emphasised and people making it a life and death situation rather then accepting the fact that it's ok to lose and it's ok to win .Dude it's a game .. ..

Subway Surfers,This game is one my childhood classics. The game was extremely entertaining but I would also get really sad as I never really had enough keys to purchase anything. I downloaded the game about 2 years ago again and I have to say... The changes are excellent. I think the ads are incorporated really well into the game and it doesn't get annoying. I have enough bits  keys  event coins and all the extra stuff in just the right amount. I love this game :),POSITIVE,0,0.999686718,22-Apr-24
Subway Surfers,I love this game  but since last year  there are so many things added especially the quests and events  so there's alot of popups and it's annoying .

Anyway  I love the game overall,NEGATIVE,1,0.991935253,2-Apr-24
Subway Surfers,I thoroughly enjoy the game it's great that the location changes every month plus there are different challenges so you don't get bored. It would be nice if you had a day/night option for the locations like Tokyo is always set in the night time but it would be nice to have a day time option. Also if you could change hoverboards and characters midgame.,POSITIVE,0,0.99930644,26-Mar-24
Subway Surfers,Subway Surfers  is an exhilarating endless runner game set in various vibrant locations around the world. Players navigate subway tracks  avoiding obstacles and collecting coins. The game's dynamic graphics and smooth controls make it engaging  while regular updates introduce new challenges and themes. The diverse characters and hoverboards add a personal touch to the gameplay. However  some may find the in-app purchase system a bit aggressive.,POSITIVE,0,0.999409199,11-Dec-23
Subway Surfers,I have been playing Subway Surfers for approximately 3 years at a stretch now and while I cannot say it is free of flaws  it is also not easy for a game to be so regardless. I have been very pleased with the themes and character designs and the game definitely only keeps improving. I am also very pleased with the services provided by the staff and their quick and professional responses to mail.

Subway Surfers,Subway Surfers captivates players with its fast-paced endless running and vibrant graphics  offering an addictive mobile gaming experience. The intuitive swipe controls make it accessible to all ages  enhancing its widespread appeal.

Subway Surfers,Love the game. Amazing offline game for plane or long car rides  but when I had to switch phones I lost my really good account with hours and hours of work put into it  and I can't get it back  I had scores in the millions and it's all lost because I had to switch phones  I also had a lot of limited characters and hoverboards  also all my achievements and money  keys  and all my progress is all gone.

Subway Surfers,It's an okay game  not hard  not easy  quick  fun at times  at other times too slow when you restart the play. My main problem is that you can't customize boards.

Subway Surfers,Great game as far as the gameplay is concerned. It's the unlocks that drive me crazy.  Congratulations you've just unlocked the ability to unlock a new cosmetic. And just for you  if you don't won't to spend the thousand years it would take for the RNG to give you the right mystery rewards you would need to actually equip it  we're giving you the option of paying real world currency.  It gets a little old. Like I said though  great gameplay.,POSITIVE,0,0.986867309,18-Apr-24
Subway Surfers,I love the game and have been playing it for years. The only reason for the 4 star is because there is nothing i can buy with coins other than boosters  hoverboards & skip missions. I have played the game so much  where i have over 10 million unused coins. And the chests are also really annoying to open. I would love an update where you can open all of the chests at once. I spend so much time opening chests  where i get annoyed up to the point where i don't really want to play anymore.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996492922,21-Apr-24
Subway Surfers,Thank you subway surfers for letting me lose millions of points  rewards and coins!! I appreciate it!! Stop endorsing and sponsoring Lego NinjaGQ(with the red background)!!

It's a good game  but not recently!! Thanks!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.990590572,24-Apr-24
Subway Surfers,I love this game  it's an amazing stress-free game. I only have one problem with it  sometimes after i die I'll watch an ad to carry on and the game crashes and removes the rewards i might've of won or if i beat my high score  it would erase the run. Other than that  it's a great game. It's a game that doesn't need Wi-Fi to work  and it's a good way to use time in long car rides or plane rides.,POSITIVE,0,0.998912454,2-Apr-24
Subway Surfers,Great game. I would recommend that you update it to show the recent high scores you've achieved. It would be great. Also there's no need of having too much coins and not being able to use it because the characters are either bought or purchased by keys or by completing tasks. Find a way in which you can enable one to buy characters  boards or outfits using coins.,POSITIVE,0,0.999048293,4-Apr-24
Subway Surfers,I like this game a lot. I have some feedback though. If you have incentivized ads  you do NOT need forced ads. I lose a run. I'm asked if I want to watch an ad to keep going. I say no. I am then forced to watch an ad. It's unfair and ruins the experience. I have opted to watch ads for rewards many times. I truly don't mind ads. What bothers me is a disregard for my wishes. I said no  and I was forced anyway.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999701917,19-Apr-24
Subway Surfers,I think it's a good game  but if u can  add some more 3D like adding a pet for characters  and season wise like rainy days  it can be rainy and winter days it's ice falling from sky like that  it makes gamers some excitement to play this  these are some ideas from me.

Subway Surfers,I tried clones of this gameâthis game is almost fair  and doesn't require tilting; the latter is an advantage. I also like the event. But: As of writing  I've encountered 4 times where there was no path clear of trains  or an obstacle in front of a train behind it. The sections are all the same  not even mirrored. Only 3 lanes  not 2 or 4. There's many annoyances/addictions.

Overall everything about this game is good. Yeah it has ads but so you can get things  like power ups and such.

Subway Surfers,Great game  the season events keep things fresh and exciting. However  it's annoying that players have to wait for each tier of season hunt rewards to unlock.

Subway Surfers,Played for a few days. PROS: endless runner w/ different elevations as gameplay  & playable offline. CONS: very exploitive ad implementation  watch ads 2 win (it's unlimited rewards in my experience)  characters is just skin (nothing unique other than the design)  one area only (it's not even a subway) & no other game modes. OVERALL: I had fun at first but it gets repetitive. I think this is a modern take for a runner  comparing to temple run  but the ads just made it worst. Best played offline.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998989999,26-Mar-24
Subway Surfers,This game is pretty nice . But some times it just gets too frustrating. I feel a bit disappointed that people who don't buy certain bundles with real money don't get some really cool characters   they are not given a chance also other than buying those packs . The current season challenges get so irritating to watch so many ads and get to scores of almost 6.8m 5m seriously. I'm a player for really long but the new updates don't seem to amaze at all nor are the characters cool enough.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99879837,2-Apr-24
Subway Surfers,I'm an occasional gamer and decided to try something different. This game is fun  tricky to navigate the character at first  but after a few tries I'm getting used to it.

Subway Surfers,very good endless runner game. there are a bunch of stuff that needs ads but if u watch 10 of them it will give you a box  mystery box and a super mystery box. lots of skins  this game is perfect for me. I absolutely recommend it to anyone.

Subway Surfers,A really solid experience. I remember playing this almost everyday on my phone  deciding to revisit this game is probably one of my greatest decisions this month.

This is a game I would recommend to people just starting with electronics and the people who have been here awhile!,POSITIVE,0,0.977557003,18-Mar-24
Subway Surfers,I love the game it's interesting but recently have not been playing it cause it's kind of furstrating . Cause it's so annoying to lose your progress maybe from 100 coin to 0 how do you expect someone to feel...?NICE! Just create maybe a subway cloud or something you can link your game to and save your progress that all I have for you guys . Thanks ð¤,NEGATIVE,1,0.996136129,15-Mar-24
Subway Surfers,Ad watching simulator  sure  the gameplay is fun  but it's literally watch ads to win. All the events are horrible too  for example  in the tag time event  the further you go on the less clocks you get! and after every single game no matter where you play they give you the option to watch ads to continue! even the season pass  you can only get so far every day  but   you can skip the wait with keys  which you can also get by watching ads. This game used to be great  but now it's ruined.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999243021,3-Apr-24
Subway Surfers,I love this game. It's an instant classic. The endless running  the new locales  the incredible visuals... My only criticisim is I wish there was a way to just play classic subway surfers with no world tour. Don't get me wrong  I love the World tour  it's just... I want a taste of nostalgia for once. Other than that  God tier.,POSITIVE,0,0.999499321,17-Mar-24
Subway Surfers,This game is very fun to play. However  the problem is the ads itself. I'm using a very fast internet connection just to watch ads that gave me keys. Yet your game said that I have internet problems. I really don't like that. There is one ads showed up however but the ad is also the problem. It says it has granted the reward but when I close it  it doesn't give me anything. Can you please fix all of this? I appreciate your work. I'm hoping the ad problem won't be a thing in the future.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994272113,15-Mar-24
Subway Surfers,I love and adore this game + perfect for offline gamings  mostly use this for when going to other places  like the hospital! I mostly play events to get rewards and so far no progress at all :(. I'm not complaining though! I just wish there was some lore or story to it you know? But still I love the graphics and how the game works! The events are so fun and stuff!!! Definetely recommend if playing offline  although no wifi has limitations to it! Love the game so far!!! <3,POSITIVE,0,0.998046517,19-Mar-24
Subway Surfers,You used to be able to play and get at least some monthly skins and boards with the coins  but now they are all either real money or an exorbitant amount of the square tokens  keys  or challenges. I'm actually fine with the challenges when they don't lock the levels as a cheap way of making you come back each day. Also  my God  the ads are unrelenting.  Watch an ad to get something? Don't bother clicking no cause we're giving you an ad anyway.   Just sad to see it fall so far,NEGATIVE,1,0.993028224,26-Feb-24
Subway Surfers,Honestly really well made  and their is a drive to get more skins and boards  but the only problem is that they just added too many things over the years  making it confusing. But other than that  I think that Subway Surfers is an actual good game other than the minor negatives  of course. Overall  it is recommended for all ages  honestly.,POSITIVE,0,0.99745065,4-Mar-24
Subway Surfers,I am playing this game since 2018 and this game is still worthy! But I miss the older version of the Subway Surfers game. I hate the underwater version of escaping. I want the older tracks and trains running and bridges. It was so nice. Please change the game to older version as soon as possible!!!!,POSITIVE,0,0.873220384,25-Apr-24
Subway Surfers,I really don't know what's happening right now. I used to play subway surfers when it first came out it was amazing so I downloaded it again coz I missed it. When I downloaded it  the changes were so amazing  after some days It stopped loading when it reached 78%. I restarted the app nothing changed  restarted my phone nothing changed and even updated the app nothing changed. Please can u fix the problem  I really want to play,NEGATIVE,1,0.999193847,25-Feb-24
Subway Surfers,Subway surfers used to be extremely fun and addictive still is however 1.the amount of ads have increased tremendously  I get it you need income but to claim stuff you earned by watching ads on challenges? Very annoying. 2. I like the updates but their getting a bit...too recent to claim everything you would like 3.I love the difficulty but on the hurdles challenge  legendary mode but how can I tell fakes. 4.some items that used to be free COST money?I like the game very much overall.,POSITIVE,0,0.992155612,26-Apr-24
Subway Surfers,Been a player since the the app was released but some of the ways ads are implemented is ruining the experience and my ability to enjoy the game. After the latest update I can't even buy Mystery boxes as I used to without watching ads. Imo it should be optional when it comes to extra rewards. Also having to watch ads to clear missions instead of having the option of paying with coins is not great  especially while offline. I've saved up coins  let me use them please.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999251068,7-Mar-24
Subway Surfers,This is the best game I have ever played.I tried to find it's end  but I never found it. I hope that every person will try in. This game as this is my favorite  and I am sure they will love it. And the happiest moment of this game is when I make a new high score. I'm sure the person who made this game is very creative. It is fun winning prizes  jumping on the trains  collecting mystery boxes  and winning season hunts. Every person should try this game once in their life. Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!,POSITIVE,0,0.999846816,22-Apr-24
Subway Surfers,Absolutely love this game  no comments or concerns. I love this game since it has no ads interfering with the gameplay so your free to play as long as you won't without watching 10 ads at a time  and The only times you have to pay is for token and ect. So It's not trying to make you buy something just to make it to a new level. This game is well thought and organized  absolutely one of the game that I will play till my grave.,POSITIVE,0,0.998818696,4-Mar-24
Subway Surfers,Worst app forces you into watching a ad  Also I was just trying to install the app but then I didn't have enough space so I took away like 2 apps and then I accidentally put uninstall and then I tried it again it was trying to make me delete more apps literally I only have like 5 apps it's like it wants to delete my whole phone and the quality when your going to fast it lags up your phone to pause for a second and then next thing you know it you hit a train (my opinion) bad game:/,NEGATIVE,1,0.999719918,27-Apr-24
Subway Surfers,classic game  simple and entertaining. but lately  EVERYTHING is just pay-to-win. any special/event surfer  boards etc. edit: the game would be a lot better if you could buy more stuff with coins/keys/event tokens instead of ONLY having the option of paying real money  since it's a simple game that not a lot of people play fanatically,NEGATIVE,1,0.989855886,12-Feb-24
Subway Surfers,Has potential  but is just an adbox. DEFINITELY needs a multiplayer mode!!!!!!. You can get everything using ads. Also it glitches and doesn't turn when I tell the character to. Used to be good. The rewards are very bad compared to how long you play.ð¡,NEGATIVE,1,0.997784793,16-Apr-24
Subway Surfers,Good game but I have a problem with events. I don't know if they always do this but it's happening now. I was doing an event that said  complete all 5 stages to unlock this character  and after I got to I think level 2 or 3 it said I had to wait like 2 days or something before I could keep playing or pay 16 keys. It's really dumb. During events with timers there will literally be timers in places that are unteachable so I end up running out of time and it's not even my fault.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994559109,9-Apr-24
Subway Surfers,honestly love this have been playing for a while now and I will say the ads are a small bit annoying but if you ut on airplane mode or turn off WiFi and mobile data you will be fine. amazing way to pass time and brilliant for flights. occasionally it does lag for thirty seconds or so but I barely even notice so it really doesn't bother me. 10/10,POSITIVE,0,0.997977555,2-Apr-24
Ludo King,The overall game is amazing. But the problem is in Snake & Ladders especially; where sometimes I feel like the game is biased  means LITERALLY ! I have won only a few times in it as the opponent (Computer/AI  as I mostly play offline) somehow manages to win. When I'm almost close to winning  but the AI opponent somehow wins because he gets the winning gap no. in the dice and I lose  despite being so close. Otherwise  I have no problems as I don't play online too much  so I won't complain.FIX IT!,POSITIVE,0,0.66908282,5-Mar-24
Ludo King,I recently used this app and I'm really disappointed the app had several issues that made it difficult to use The app crashed frequently  causing me to lose progress and requiring constant restarts. It took forever for the app to load and navigate  even on a high-speed connection I wouldn't recommend this application to anyone .. WORST APPLICATION I took my friends on waiting this application is not working properly....,NEGATIVE,1,0.999790728,28-Apr-24
Ludo King,Sadly there aren't enough ads  distractions  and interruptions in the game  which is why I wish I could give it zero. Update: more of the above plus the game is not random at all; the higher the the player's rank the more likely they will win. Update # 2: my review has been sitting here for years and the issue has not been addressed yet  and even when I update my review the developers only address the second issue not the original issue. Digitally controlled  luck  as you call it beats strategy.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998041153,27-Mar-24
Ludo King,This game really sucks. And  eats ear brain once any person is daily habituated to play. He purchase coins with real money and with more and more coins  he goes for big coins and eventually loose all. And  finally I have signed out and uninstalling this app  as I should have won big amount of coins  only it's just number one to be rolled  and the opponent person finished right from his home and came till end and won  and I didn't get one number rolled up. So  this really is a worst game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999754131,29-Apr-24
Ludo King,I personally feel that the Dice is biased towards some people And whenever I play with the computer then the fact is that only they win I always lose when I play with computer It's better to get a real ludo for yourself rather than playing this game .. It consumes a lot of data...and obviously there are so many ads that pop ups on the screen Overall it's a very disgusting and a very low level game.. I'll not consider it for anyone ðððð,NEGATIVE,1,0.999699116,23-Mar-24
Ludo King,It's frustrating to experience the bias in Ludo King firsthand  as it seems like no matter how strategically I play  certain opponents always seem to get the upper hand. It's disheartening to feel like the game is working against me  especially when it becomes apparent that some players consistently benefit from more favorable outcomes. Despite the developers' assurances of randomness  it's hard not to question the fairness of the algorithms when faced with such persistent patterns. L app fr,NEGATIVE,1,0.993515968,4-Mar-24
Ludo King,The dice is totally biased ...they make winner by their choice only. Whenever I want large no. the dice is suddenly showing only 1 or 2 or less no. Or else happened totally opposite. When I m about to win  the dice suddenly pop the no. For the opponent so they can beat mine so I m automatically got lose the game. Overall the game is totally biased. Worst experience ð.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999772966,9-Apr-24
Ludo King,I have playing it quite a long time and I can guarantee  it is never a random number based game. There are pre installed pattern of numbers to come and if you can follow the pattern there is chance that you can win while moving the tokens accordingly. Why 3 sixes never come in sequence..why two tokens never overplace..if the numbers are really random. Can be played for timepass and fun..but developer should not claim it as random number certified.,NEGATIVE,1,0.989614964,17-Apr-24
Ludo King,It was one of the most biased games to play. This should not be the case since they said in their loading description that it is  always random dice rolls.  LIES. The game selects who wins 100% of the time. Someone should sue them for  guaranteeing random rolls.  the never ending adds they run during the game is just crazy with that many adds  and the game selecting winners  the players should get paid. I wish everyone could delete their app even just for a couple of weeks until they fix it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999416828,21-Apr-24
Ludo King,Am certainly disappointed on these dice and getting lost with all the coins once the amount is increased and only the opponents are winning with the huge amount and am losing the coins for past few games afterall I have gained the coins check on the algorithms and fix the match accordingly . opponents who are with the more coins are winning and the lesser are losing this is more as a match-fixing get fix to ur bug..,NEGATIVE,1,0.999762237,8-Apr-24
Ludo King,KEY to leave game   Auto exit 1) if in beginning of game your opponent has 4 pieces out & you have just 1  you will not win 2) Your opponent suddenly starts getting more 6 on dice than you are getting. 3) if your opponent comes to your starting point has already has his 2nd piece on his starting line & you are still waiting for 6. I have experienced this probably a thousand times   so now i quit & save time whenever i Observe such games. Actually they should look into this & resolve .,NEGATIVE,1,0.997641921,28-Apr-24
Ludo King,It might be right to say it a *WORST APP*. You cheated my 10000 coins on 01/04/2024 at 1:38 am. Your app doesn't work properly  I challenged a player for rematch. Didn't connected with that still 5 000 coins deducted and when I tried to play a new game with any other random player app got hang and deducted those 5000 coins also. Then after shown that you lost previous game . All I want is return my coins back in my score.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999752223,31-Mar-24
Ludo King,Totally biased game.... It's always shows that it's going to make winner the other person. Right now I was playing this game... All my coins went to home and for just one coin I lose meanwhile the 2nd person's 3 coins get clear and he wins and other hand I can't even make 1 coin clear....

Ludo King,Recently I've been experiencing some problems with my opponents. I get matched with the same player and they seem to be using hacks or something. I could predict their next dice. And also they seem to win easily before I even come out of my home. It's sad to say but ludo king use to be my fav and now it's my least favorite amongst the games I play. Also I wish we could report the players as some intentionally delay the game so that we could exit the game and they win. Such a bad game spirit.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999715507,31-Mar-24
Ludo King,This is the worst game I ever played   the game algorithm is fixed by your profile status if the opponent player have a higher winning record it's simply fixed him as a winner and you as a looser. If the opponent coin left by one he easy get a more 26 digits in single dice chance . It's totally awful,NEGATIVE,1,0.999796569,20-Apr-24
Ludo King,Worst game ever .This game is biased over certain opponents.If you win once in a game  then you will fail thrice .when you are about to win in just one move  but you won't win the opponents will win .You can easily predict the dice number of opponents.This happens everytime .Its just a time pass game  but it hurts when you lose all the time .You can easily predict the winner .If you play six players game  then the opponents with more coins are the winner .I'm gonna delete this worst application.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999772251,21-Apr-24

Ludo King,I suggest please don't download this fraud game it will definitely take your time and make you waste from every situation.Its totally a biased game and whenever you are having low coins then you can definitely predict the one who's going to win. For every purpose such as to have coins  to chat etc everywhere it is charging us and totally it's a trap for us.

Ludo King,Updated review: This game is biased towards members who pay. My friend and I tested this. The game makes may swear and repeat that their algorithm is perfect  but it is a white lie and I find it funny that the company unabashedly refuses to accept it. Enjoy the game while it lasts. Do not play games that cost above 5000 coins and do NOT expect random numbers from the dice. There are games where my opponent kept getting sixes on dice when i struggled to get one six in 37 moves  ,POSITIVE,0,0.9936831,17-Apr-24
Ludo King,Unfair/ poor algorithm. Get 1 or 2 (on dice) 3-5 times continuously while others gets 5s-6s for 2-3 times makes it sometimes uncompetitive and unfair so disaapointment.

Ludo King,It's very Disappointment that if you have More Points you will win this game. The numbers are not coming Equally in Dice. The person who is having more points getting more Numbers in Dice. It's should be Equal as always. You can easily Predict the winner with Points itself. No point of Playing if you have less points. Will not suggest my friends about this game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99963522,28-Apr-24
Ludo King,Good news  a better alternative to this game - I downloaded Ludo Titan and liked the game. Graphics and UI is different  but good. All dice rolls happen together  e.g if there is a 6  6 and 2  you can play it as per the game situation and break your token moves accordingly. DO DOWNLOAD LUDO TITAN. Ludo King is absolutely rigged  biased  unethical and unfair. Finally a good alternative has been found  do try.,NEGATIVE,1,0.984233201,13-Apr-24
Ludo King,1 star It seems that the game is designed to be completely one-sided and biased  favoring certain players over others. Despite my best efforts  my opponent consistently gets all the favorable numbers and wins every game. It feels as if the system is rigged in favor of players who have installed the app before others. This has led to an unfair and frustrating gaming experience for me.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999129236,21-Feb-24
Ludo King,So much bad experience. Too be honest the Numbers are not RANDOM. This is all just lie. I've played more than 500 games and observed that these numbers aren't random like when someone is chasing me  i always get 1 - 2 - 3 and they get the perfect numbers which are required to kill me 90% times which isn't possible because the chance of getting a perfect no. is 1/6. Many times when you are at the end and you need 1 to win  u will never get it like NEVER and the opponent gets multiple 6 and win.,NEGATIVE,1,0.984476745,8-Apr-24

Ludo King,The Ul is the best amongst the peers. The game speed is excellent. However  after a while you realise that the game is biased towards certain opponents. Also  if you play 4 player games  you will find that the games are fixed. It might sound strange but one can easily predict the next dice number. Pls improve your game algorithms. Its becoming boring and frustrating and at times.,NEGATIVE,1,0.726830244,5-Feb-24
Ludo King,Dice results are not natural and it is easily predictable. It seems it is set with sum fixed algorithm and will make you loose so that you see the ads to gain few coins to play again.

Ludo King,So much Worst experience it is absolutely baised game  if you have more coins then your opponent then you rarely win. It gives only 1 2 3 and Max 4 maximum time and 5 and 6 rarely. But the opponent gets double 6  5  4 maximum and 1 2 3 less often.

Extremely biased!,NEGATIVE,1,0.998077154,10-Mar-24
Ludo King,worst game ever ... always helps my opponent to win the game and the snake and ladder game is the worst each and every time I'm winning at the beginning and suddenly the snakes decide that they are not going to let me win the game but it's the opposite for other players ... when they say bad things about me in the game i start to loose whereas when i do the same they start to win... Also there are too many ads,NEGATIVE,1,0.999623775,6-Mar-24
Ludo King,it is the most rigged app. it will almost always give your opponent 6's and big number and the exact numbers to kill you. the other features are ok. but the game is just time pass because you can clearly see who is going to win. most of the time they give big numbers to people with less coins to keep them interested,NEGATIVE,1,0.989102364,5-Mar-24
Ludo King,I am losing every game...how come opponents are getting all the 5s and 6s twice and thrice? And I get all the 1s and 2s. Whenever I cross the opponent the dice never shows bigger number so that opponent can hit me.. Please fix this stupid move. This game is biased.

Ludo King, Random numbers guaranteed  is a white lie and a joke. Too annoying coz it gives the perfect numbers. The exact numbers you need at the exact time.

I mostly lose even tho I'm very close to winning and the opponent has 1 piece left to move out he she moves and gets double 6 then 5 mostly and wins the game while I'm stuck with 3 pieces which can't even enter home. The opponent always seems to get perfect numbers and eats my pawns and 9 out of 10 times the opponent hits 6 first.

Ludo King,Very nicely developed game. Couple of things if could be implemented can give users more real time experience. Like below : 1. User should be given liberty to roam his token as pet wish without forcing to go inside home after an entire circle move is finish. 2. User should be given opportunity to double up toke in any given place and the rule for double up should work. If more information required please reach out.

Ludo King,Game sucks the die isn't truly random  which is the main attraction in any dice game  so it's not based on luck. And you keep responding to these reviews of players by aaying saying the dice are random. If the first ten reviews on this app are players saying that the rolls aren't random. (It's way more than the first ten reviews btw) then clearly the rolls aren't random! We can't all be noticing the same flaw in the game! Fix your algorithm!,NEGATIVE,1,0.99766469,10-Feb-24
Ludo King,Ludo king is the of the best game but still it makes me feel irritated at that point when I'm gonna win the match with one number and my opponent win while he/she too far way . In online mode While playing I maximum time see that my opponent most of the get the best and higher number in first.it feel like my opponent get that number in dice which he or she want and me just get 6 numberð²one or two time only in whole game .,NEGATIVE,1,0.98755151,16-Apr-24
Ludo King,Hello there Gametion! I am a big fan of Ludo King playing since 2018 (when it used to be displayed Gametronix instead of Gametion). I am really happy for your success all over the years. I am really happy that this is the first Indian game to cross 1 Billion downloads. This is a proud moment for me. But I also feel that this game is turning into money game and to buy some emotes or avatar icons  we need to buy the passes. Also  the themes  which costed only coins  now costs real money and 1K ads,POSITIVE,0,0.993956685,11-Apr-24
Ludo King,Nice game. Like the options to play in different styles  no. of players even offline match. But the word loser can be changed to runner even in 2 player match. I think it gives a negative feel to player.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998149753,30-Mar-24
Ludo King,So much of ads  and worst algorithm. Dices are not random and sometime it feels like it has chosen you to lose. Worst experience ð.

Ludo King,I have faced several instances where I am about to win (with help of strategy and good play); only for the algorithm to not give me numbers to reach home...while the opponent gets time to start from home base and reach the end...so frustrating to lose when you play well...Rigged as f,NEGATIVE,1,0.998447657,25-Apr-24
Ludo King,I'll be honest  firstly I don't even know for how long this game has been in my phone  secondly I enjoyed playing this game. But the problem is that in ludo when you just need a one to get the first win  this game won't give you that particular number and the opponent would win even if he isn't even near winning. And I'm really annoyed by that.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995999575,5-Apr-24
Ludo King,The game is totally biased...it will always make you lose among the opponents if u are playing with computers And seldom with players who spend money In this game. I personally feel that the game is totally predictable that you can predict the probability of the number of the dice of your opponent becoz it will make your token to be cut and there are also many more problems related with this Stupid game and for sure I could say that the game is In someone's domain,NEGATIVE,1,0.999754131,28-Mar-24
Ludo King,It is a purely fraud game...one sided and biased... when you are almost to win in one move and you have tried too many ð² s...but you won't win.. opponents will win simply...not only in 1 or 2 games  in every game repeating same thing. We can easily guess the dies ð² number of opponents... this game don't work based on your luck...it is a pre programmed. If we install this game definitely you will get frustrated.

Ludo King,It's the most biased game I've ever in on play store.. I will never recommend anyone to play this at all..

Do not ever play this.......,NEGATIVE,1,0.999392986,17-Apr-24
Ludo King,Very poor algorithm set by the coder..There are lot of issues in this game..If u miss a single opportunity than u will be punished harshly  specially if you miss to send home to your dice... Opponents will get higer numbers if they are behind You will never see that it is taking more than 5 chance to get a six while in physical ludo this possibility is very high... overall I don't think that any research is done before designing the game..,NEGATIVE,1,0.999521971,21-Feb-24
Ludo King,This game is awful!!!! Especially when that point when you're gonna win with one and then you'll have to wait for your entire life and then your opponent comes and wins.

And the another one sometimes we not even get chance to kill others token but the another opponent get 10 times opportunity to kill the token even if he is far from our token ...

In starting you will win the max game but after time u will lose game percent is more than your win .. pls improve the mistake ðð»ðð»ðð»,NEGATIVE,1,0.990017951,17-Feb-24
Ludo King,What's the purpose of showing your logo for 20 seconds? This is so irritating nd frustrated. Before playing games  you are supposed to stare at screen for 20 seconds  such a awful experience. Replying to Team's reply Dear  I connect my mobile with high speed Wi-Fi.

Ludo King,Worst game I have played ever because every time in LUDO my dice always comes 1.

Ludo King,Ludo King is too good but if possible by developers  one thing should be changed n that is in 6P game 1st price 47k is okay but 2nd price should be atleast 27k and 3rd should be 10k and 4th and 5th winners would get only wins n no coins. If 3 players somehow leave the game; then 3rd player won't get a win but get 10k surely. Please do the needful.

Ludo King,If I wanted I would rate this app in minus.It is a fraud and clearly biased towards a player.I feel so bad angry and frustrated when I lose because of the game is one sided.It is better to play indoor offline ludo with friends because at least we get random numbers when we roll the dice.I just lost a game where I had 3 tokens not even near my house and the opponent won.I hope this helps you understand that playing ludo offline is better than playing ludo online.I un recommend this biased game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999320984,26-Apr-24

Ludo King,This game is so awful......so one sided and dumb game ever. wish I could give it -ve rating.... All these positive reviews are either bot or old reviews. Random number my foot. Such a poor algorithm  it decides the winner beforehand right after you start the game no matter what how you choose to play if game has decided its winner you ain't gonna win and if you are first one to get six in the starting of game then you are definitely not gonna win the game  this game is totally flawed....,NEGATIVE,1,0.999762475,9-Apr-24
Ludo King,Winners are already decided in this app.....in this game they make sure that player must become addictive to this game  they first let the new users win in this game so that they start liking the game but after a few days the new users start losing (which is already decided as you don't get good number in dice) and due to less coins they do spin for coins but even in that they don't get many coins  then you watch ads so that you get coins  then you play the game again but you again start losing,NEGATIVE,1,0.998347759,14-Apr-24
Ludo King,This is good. But there r some corrections need to be implemented. 1. After cutting any coin  the cutting coin should go back to it's home directly and fast instead of taking complete round of the board. 2. First coin should be open immidiatly after starting the game for each player. 3. The coin counting should be very fast and directly should reach it final position instead counting one bye one step.

My tokens always gets hit  it's impossible for players to miss them. Even when I'm far  a player will hit 6 6 & 5. Just to hit my last token.

Free Fire,I would be rating it a 5 star but in the past years. The authorities have changed all the things about the games and there have been too many updates in the game which have changed the experience. I mean like removing the all the old places and changing the whole game. Bringing back old and rare bundles. I wish that those things could come back,NEGATIVE,1,0.997992039,5-Mar-24
Free Fire,I have been playing free-fire for 3 years but the feeling I used to get earlier is not available now. The main reason for that is that they are giving different types of characters  then giving away Bermuda map picks  old bundles giving speed again and again  giving away a lot of new things  the game is getting ruined slowly  it's not just my words  most players will say the same thing. We request you not to spoil the game again.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999769747,18-Apr-24
Free Fire,It is a nice game but then the network issue is a thing of concern (1) you can be shooting at an enemy at first sight but the game will glitch and u discover ur shots were bluffs with no damages or points but instead u receive damages from ur opponent's shots. (2) whenever the network disconnects during a game play honor scores are being deducted. This isn't nice  you have to consider the fact that many players do experience geniue connection problems.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997950375,17-Apr-24
Free Fire,I am seeing a glitch in my game since last two months  which is not showing enemy's dress up  gun skin  and other collection in game (Battle Royale Rank).

This is slowly becoming a huge glitch  so garenar is requested to fix this issue.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997640848,19-Apr-24
Free Fire,The game is best in it's own. Firstly  I would like to remember that  all games are made for entertainment and fun. But in this game i have found that there is a race kind of thing against each other as well as a lots of controversy due to the weaknesses of garena. Secondly there is no fare fight as one who has skin  character  pet can easily beat the another as he/she has more advantage. Third one is ping problem. Main thing is there must be fare fight. There must be fareness in every thing.,NEGATIVE,1,0.977151692,17-Apr-24
Free Fire,I Free Fire offers fast-paced  adrenaline-pumping gameplay with its compact battle royale format.

Free Fire,Good job you have made it 200% sensitivity. Now we have got 200 times faster head shot  even we deploy glue walls we are getting head shots. Even faster reaction time is not enough and also after update device is getting hotter much faster and lagy. Old player's are uninstall the game. Because 200% sensitivity  it's too easy to make a head shot even level 3 helmet can't save us. More like playing head shot hack. It's a pointless game now no fun anymore. I suggest make lower the aim assist.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999292374,18-Apr-24
Free Fire,My score had gone down. That's why I paid more attention to the game and played Lone Wolf more and more times but my score didn't increase even 1 time.

So I request garena to solve this problem as soon as possible..I haven't been able to play rank match for this reason!!solve this problem fast otherwise I'll report,NEGATIVE,1,0.998565495,18-Apr-24
Free Fire,Well  the game is fine. The graphics a bit poor and it's laggy a lot. But there's biggest problem and it's When I shoot a headshot  they don't count it so in my mind I think that I damaged him a headshot so I just shoot twice but then they kill me fast because of that. Please count the headshots or I'll cry. Also the clothes most of them ugly  you are not good at designing  especially the female clothes most of them revealing which makes me disgusted. I hope you fix the bugs.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99954164,17-Apr-24

Free Fire,Lots of lags pls make the bugs and hackers not allow to enter the game and make the squad hold more than 4 players also tons of errors and bad network connection between/among players and let us get diamonds in the game plus let us get one emote in starting up the game without paying MONEY. plus the game got so much updated so much times my phone cannot install all the other updates and the game would not let me play unless i update it which i cannot do because when i click update it said error.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999466836,19-Apr-24
Free Fire,This game is REAL FUN. And it super duper addicting ð¤©. But I only have 1 suggestion for the developer : when like players are jumping from a place  they should be able to shoot while in mid-air  that's like the only thing I want. All in all  this is a great game! You should definitely try this!ðððð,POSITIVE,0,0.996957421,17-Apr-24
Free Fire,It is a very good game and better than other many online games but I think you should fix it. The problem is lag you should fix it by bringing a grafics of potato. It means that you should bring officially potato grafic for low end device. It will be better for low end device player to play it. I am really saying that I was going to give 5 out of 5 but I faced a problem of lag.

Free Fire,The game is nice  it has good graphics and the gameplay is cool. But their are some issues; (1) The game gets more difficult as you proceed and sometimes annoying and at times you will be shooting at an enemy and he will not die but one shot from the enemy on me and then I am dead. I feel that there is a little partiality in the game (2)The gems are too costly to afford and the demand for gems to purchase an item is too high. Pls if you will hear me fix this .,NEGATIVE,1,0.998172998,16-Apr-24

Free Fire,Very poor matchmaking  the worst I have seen. Since the new CS season I cannot play a match without a bot. Is it because people have left the game that you decided to be filling up squads with bot. Every match 10 to 11 kills and a defeat. Am currently on a 6 loss streak  last game was no different ( with 15 cs ranked kills). Just to see that my teammates had 0 kills each. Very bad of free fire. Ban afk pple for 5 mins at least.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999724686,18-Apr-24
Free Fire,I have been playing this game for nearly a year now  and it has got to be one of the best Battle royales out there  except for a few bugs. I noticed that the headshot lag isn't fixed despite regular updates. I choose the lowest graphics settings yet sometimes it lags when someone headshots me and my fps drops. Also  most frustratingly  the fake damage isn't fixed. Players have 200 health but when I shoot them the damage surpasses 200 by a mile. Pls fix  but keep up the Good work!,POSITIVE,0,0.576855779,25-Feb-24
Free Fire,It's meant to be a nice game  but there are so many factors that are hindering the game from getting that title such as: (1). The network issue! (2).Being paired against players that use controllers or PC knowing fully well that they have a higher advantage on everything. (3). Having to reset all settings after reinstallation. (4). Lastly  the network issues again! It's really annoying and even more annoying that the developers don't listen to complaints.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999571025,24-Feb-24

Free Fire,Played Free Fire for a good while and I can say that it is really interesting. But I only have 1 problem  I just finished a game and had to say this after I lost it but  can you please stop directing our next shots to people we've already knocked out  it's so annoying. Just imagine knocking out one opponent  the next one is ready to knock out and the shots are hitting the downed opponent  giving the opposite team a chance to knock me out  and this is my favorite game and I can play this game.,POSITIVE,0,0.995511532,17-Apr-24
Free Fire,Very epic exciting game  great graphics  epic & new maps. I love the the new red background colour and airplane red colour  it also has lights now. My network experience has been quite stable ever since making my gameplay crystal smooth. Though I have issues with aiming at a targets head  it just won't raise that fast . I also wish they could activate the red arrow when an enemy is close by  not when he is already at you. Overall  2nd best 3D shooter game after COD.,POSITIVE,0,0.999042809,3-Mar-24

Free Fire,Your not sorry as you've done nothing about it and I explained the issue perfectly so I shouldn't need to contact.

Free Fire,The overall game experience is excellent! However: 1. No one can change the game region (most players don't speak English). 2. Some players think they use cheat codes. For example  you might see someone crossing an obstacle like a glue wall. Moreover  others earned as many as 15 headshot streaks in a single game. Isn't it strange and unusual? 3. The most disturbing part is that of cheating and hacking,NEGATIVE,1,0.75698489,22-Feb-24

Cricket League,The problem is matchmaking with only high level player  my level is 30 but I get only players of level 60 70 100. Also opponents use dirty tricks like network connection  which freezes the screen and nothing happens  so I have to quit the match  which results in losing. Nowadays  game is lagging more.

Cricket League,Would be a good game if it didn't keep giving an error message stating that there is no Internet connection when there clearly is! Losing loads of coins due to this. Also you have to accept intrusive  personalised  ads on your device in order to receive extra coins etc. Also  I've lost loads more coins playing opponents who seem to leave the game whilst I'm winning  only for the game to crash  meaning I have to leave the game.

Cricket League,I often face a problem during tour games with higher entry fees. When I'm close to winning and the game freezes without any explanation & even im not aware of the opponents trick  it becomes frustrating. Even though my internet is stable  the system doesn't notify me about the issue. After waiting for 3-4 minutes  I'm forced to exit  leading to the loss of coins based on the entry fee. This is totally unfair and annoying. System should penalized if the player is not active. Plzzz FIX IT.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999776661,5-Mar-24
Cricket League,Great game but people are cheating! This has happened multiple times with me. When I am winning a match the opponent logs off logs in  pauses or turn off their internet or something which leads to game getting stuck. It doesn't move at all  just the game gets stuck. I have screenshots to share it with the developers. You need to put a timer if game gets stuck the match coin shouldn't be deducted. I have lost thousands of coins because of this. Fix this and you have my 5 stars.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998352289,22-Apr-24
Cricket League,Target should be kept 1 run higher than the opponent score  this game gives same score as target  which is basic error from the team. And few players come up with cheat code while playing the game  which this app creators won't even take it seriously and filter them  and instead of 1 over  options should be given for more overs in a single match and some glitches in fielding time  and options should be given for placing the fielders as per bowling team instead of default fielding for all games.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998046756,5-Mar-24
Cricket League,I love the game....it is very challenging. I have played many close games.. but I think there is a MAJOR GLITCH.....that is IT ALLOWS CHEATERS TO PROSPER! There are who display unsportsmanlike behaviour... such players should be banned. It is so frustrating when you win a game but the opponent disconnects and I get the message that the opponent is connecting. Why should I lose my points when I have clearly won.

Cricket League,Miniclip seriously needs to fix the bugs in this game. To have it hang up so frequently when opponent disconnects or has connectivity issues is atrocious  especially since you do not award us the win (or at the very least reimburse us).

Cricket League,Very STUPID DEVELOPERs. Match making is pathetic. At lvl 30 so many matches with 132  273  76 lvl players. Further  When you loose then the xp/trophies shall reduce.

Cricket League,I was playing as a guest and I was at a rank 167 but they banned my I'd for attempting to exploit the game repeatedly. I never exploit the game or cheated or installed any third party app but still they banned my I'd . I emailed them two times but nothing worked as they kept on saying the same thing. I don't know why this happened maybe some players got irritated by me because they lost the game and reported wrong about me so they might have banned my I'd.

Cricket League,Extremely bad balance. Packs take ages to unlock. There is no advantage a bowler can use in the game hence at a point it becomes a game of who bata first. Added to that the pitch of the delivery is not accurate however  it keeps getting closer to the batsman instead of the stumps. If this is some conspiracy very poor and frustrating. I have stopped talking about the pathetic cheaters in the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999644399,24-Mar-24
Cricket League,This game is terrible. Everytime I play a game with a 200 coin reward I win but as soon as I join a 1000 coin game I lose no matter what. It is so boring and I have spent most of my time trying to like but it is just a game wasting your time. There are so many hackers in this game and they know exactly where I pitch. This game needs some work on it so it can be better. Finally if you get disconnected you lose the match which makes no sense. I got disconnected from a 10 000 coin game and lost.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999791801,29-Mar-24
Cricket League,Too many cheaters. Serially hit sixes having the cursor at the exact same white spot without moving an inch even within the white range area which is not possible. One more thing I've noticed is when the opponent feel they're about to lose they play some dirty trick and you lose connection and the game ends. My internet is super fast with great ping stability so that's a direct case of cheating.,NEGATIVE,1,0.992089033,9-Feb-24
Cricket League,Would've given it a higher rating  but when purchasing elite pass  it's slowed the game a lot  and rewards are level 11  I couldn't claim as the app froze.

Cricket League,I'm playing it for years now but now it lags too much sometimes even after winning it doesn't go to the main page and the screen gets stuck. In the end you lose the money for no reason. Full of cheating players and challenger players level mechanism doesn't make any sense. If you're at level 30 the system will auto match you with a player level 3x 4x higher than you. If you play negative no problem if the ball is outside the wide lines it's still a legal delivery.

PUBG MOBILE,Gaming experience have deteriorated over the past few months. Lots of fps drop and lag in server. Driving mechanics are bad  since we can't drift or use the handbrake to do power slide.

PUBG MOBILE,I absolutely love playjng this game... When I can. When I first downloaded this game so I could play with my partner it worked fine and I played constantly. But now every single time without fail the moment I start the match and jump from the plane the game crashes. Completely closes itself out. I reopen and try to join the match just for it to crash again. I haven't been able to play a single round since this started. It's really disappointing. I will change this review if it gets patched.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998086333,22-Apr-24
PUBG MOBILE,I really like the graphics and controls response as well as the overall gameplay. Some of my grievances are- gun sounds are not as engaging as they should be.

Please fix this issues.This will definitely improve the gameplay.,NEGATIVE,1,0.736737311,3-Apr-24
PUBG MOBILE,The game is very fun and exciting. You can never know where the enemy comes out and kill you from random direction. The range of weapons in the arsenal is immense and huge. You get to choose weapons from automatic weapons to single fire weapons. The weapons itself is balanced. For instance  high fire rate but low damage  high damage but higher recoil. That's what makes it balanced. However  the matches are incredibly unbalanced after the platinum rank. It gets so hard it'll be hard to adapt to.,POSITIVE,0,0.996880651,28-Mar-24
PUBG MOBILE,Still the same problem with game crashes since the update. Not just my problem but others as well while in-game. Happens 1 out of around 15-20 games. Mostly while in a car driving or mid-air on a carpet or while parachuting. Already tried repairing the game. Definitely not my phone's problem. It has 16gb of RAM and processor is well capable. Dimensity 8100. Ruins the gaming experience. UC spender here,NEGATIVE,1,0.997476161,27-Apr-24
PUBG MOBILE,Awesome game. It's action packed and filled with excitement. Filled with guns to shoot your enemies and cars so you can get to places faster.

PUBG MOBILE,Dear developers  first of all  optimise the game  I have a normal device  but the fps at times drops a lot. secondly  if you add new weapons  make it balanced  p90 is too strong. there are a couple of issues with the locations at the event  they are inconvenient to shoot from. there are a lot of situations in the game that you can not predict  there is no variety of gameplay. the point of giving the opportunity to revive  if you can not do anything against players with loot.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997342169,5-Apr-24
PUBG MOBILE,This game need some spice  please add day  dusk and dawn time mode on all maps because its getting boring theres no change on time on maps like dusk or dawn per match it is always daytime which is far too boring now.

PUBG MOBILE,This game is amazing for when your phone can't run Quality-FPS/TPS Games! The In-app Purchases aren't usually in your face unless you look for them. There are many modes varying from Classic to Custom! There are many updates / events occurring every few weeks. The Seasons are unique and changed often (â2 months).

PUBG MOBILE,Hello! I want to tell you about things that i found in this game. I found out that the movement animation of the character is outdated for nowadays standart. It's somewhat stiff. The driving cam for First Person Perspective (FPP) Camera not moving when the vehicle going up or down. We only be able to look at out character's feet or the car roof which is not really good for most fpp player. Also  some details are missing like where did the parachute go after we landed.

PUBG MOBILE,I'm playing this game since it has released  but didn't find the game lag and frame drop free from the beginning. When there is lag or sudden frame drop  we say that there is a enemy nearby. How funny! Recognizing enemy spot by a problem!

PUBG MOBILE,This app isn't fair to players when your rank is high especially when you reach in the ace's specifically ace 5 or 6 the game begins sticking they tell you to lower your graphics but before reaching that rank the graphics don't ever be a problem all of a sudden the game glitches and sticks. You don't see or hear enemies only after they kill you  then you see them. You all take a high amount of merit once someone loses in the high level but only give a little when they win.

My phone normally runs anything at max settings 60fps  except this. EDIT: So after year & half I tried again. It IS better  and I saw no cheats  when I could get a game. Graphics etc are handling better  but it's still like a guy coded it in his bedroom next to CoD (not warzone - that's diabolical). It's just so poor by comparison.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999403,10-Apr-24
PUBG MOBILE,I just got done playing the game. I caught someone cheating. The player didn't know I was hiding on the second floor of a building. The player came up the stairs  and was shooting the edge of the floor at me long before I could see the player. And when he came up the stairs he shot me. Don't tell me to report in game with screen shots etc because I know nothing about that. DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE DAMN CHEATING!! As soon as I post I'm told to edit my review. WRF is wrong with you people?!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999407768,10-Apr-24
PUBG MOBILE,Have been a fan of PUBG for a few years now  especially since the addition of metro. I enjoy running around and collecting key cards  collecting 3 including a black one in a single run one time. But  here recently there has been a loading glitch  to where as the map is loading while I'm running/first few seconds in start game  it kicks me out and I have to restart the app. And I wind up dying in game I've removed the app and downloaded it again  lowered res.  Still bugged...,NEGATIVE,1,0.99888438,20-Feb-24
PUBG MOBILE,Has potential but has some jarring flaws that ruin the whole game. Too many bots spawning right next to you  often giving away your postion. Gunplay feels okay-ish I guess  it feels stiff  and trying to shoot at a distance can be extremely stressful. Despite being on US servers  90% of players are non-English speakers so teamwork is difficult. Absurd amount of hackers  especially if you play solo. Chances of winning too luck dependent depending on who final circle favors.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998633206,15-Apr-24
PUBG MOBILE,My game does not want to load up it gets to the startup screen and opens and closes continuously.... very unhappy...

PUBG MOBILE,I love this game  but when I joined it gave my male character a female voice and all I get are female items. I sent a lot of help requests but absolutely no response. Until I get a response it's only two stars. Other than the lack of help though it is a 5 star game for sure. I just reinstalled this game after about a year away. Been queing for a match for about 3 days on and off with no luck. I'm disappointed that a really great game could just die like this.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995833397,12-Apr-24
PUBG MOBILE,New one  tried the game again. Still bad. Just died to an explosion caused by an other team where they were right next to me during the explosion but just I died.

FIX YOUR GAME and if I get an automated response like damage is affected by many factors. I swear.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999679923,2-Apr-24
PUBG MOBILE,I've been playing this game since it came out. I would jump on & play for hours on ranked. I only have one problem & it's the battle pass/royal pass. I'm not going to pay 40$ AUD just to get in game currency for it. It's always put me off from buying the battle pass. I think it's a bit too much & I get you have to make money but come on 40$ is a rip. Hopefully in the future you guys can come down on the prices.

PUBG MOBILE,PUBGM has Good game optimization with Great graphic options and many accessibility features that make the game easier to play for those who don't want to use 3-5 finger hud layouts.

Pizza Ready!,I agree with others that the free version has too many ads and it makes it pretty unplayable. I really liked the gameplay though so I decided to pay 4 USD to remove the ads  and I found it was worth it. The forced ads are gone forever but you can still choose to watch ads to get in-game improvements (it's not necessary though; only if you're impatient ð) I thoroughly enjoyed this game  although I found it highly addictive! I played all day from morning until night ð Waiting for the new levels,POSITIVE,0,0.996991396,23-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,I paid for the ad free version as I enjoyed the game but the ads every 10 seconds. Now the game has stopped letting me upgrade anything. It's reached the end of what I can do and that's with just 7 stores all max updated except the last ones expansion which it stuck on low level. Think it was just made to get quick money and it's being updated or maintained now they have lots of cash,NEGATIVE,1,0.999218106,29-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,While Pizza Ready offers a fun experience  the overwhelming number of ads significantly detracts from the gameplay. It's clear that this is designed as a pay-to-win game. Even purchasing the  no-ads  option does not alleviate the issue  as you're still required to watch numerous video ads. The game seems to rely heavily on these advertisements  as without them  players would likely progress through the game too quickly. It's a game that's best played while multitasking or doing something else.,POSITIVE,0,0.921760559,19-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,I recommend if you want to waste your time by watching ads. What about buying subscription for one week for 6$? Stages are the same story with different items/rooms. For achieving maximum upgrade for one stage you've to watch too many ads. After unlocking the stage 3 it gets harder and harder to progress. Graphics is not bad though  it's simple and nice.,POSITIVE,0,0.910036206,25-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,It's really a nice game. But there are 2 main issues which is making it annoying game from interesting game. First  there are soo many ads break. I think it should not be there bcz it reduces our interest to play games. I specially don't like too many ads in between. Second  the biggest issue  glitches in the game. I mean  it keeps on hanging alot. After every 30 seconds screen become black and then you need to restartðð.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996902227,18-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,Fun  but you get ads about every 60 seconds or so. Really disrupts the game. And  the ad-free option to pay to play without ads is not clear if it is a permanent ad free option or if if it expires after so much time. This is a game I am willing to buy if I can just play without the ads. So  if the ad-free is actually permanent  I'd do it. If not  I might delete even though I really enjoy playing.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99968636,2-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,****UPDATE**** The game still is as bad. They have done updates but no new levels. Well you get to a certain level and then there is no other levels to beat. I paid for the ad free  but the game still stalls like it is running an ad. The ads run close to a minute for any extras. If you are looking for a game to tie up your time. This is not it. You will beat it because it only has 6 levels. Not worth it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999763191,17-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,Pretty fun for what it is. Clearly it's an ad farm  but that's fine as long as it's fun. The only downside (besides ~100 ads to max out a level) is that once you're done with a restaurant  the next one just starts you over. Skills  stats  etc. don't carry over. Just your profits do. So once you max out one restaurant  you're pretty much done with the game  unless you want to repeat the same process 49 more times  including all the ad watching. Fun game  but a lot of missed potential.,NEGATIVE,1,0.947907746,2-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,Good game  too many ads  and WAY too short. I paid for no ads because I couldn't go more than 5 minutes without another ad popping up. Loved the game after that-- but there are only 7 restaurants!!! The game is super short. I don't recommend paying anything or getting hooked on this game. Find something else that make your time/money worth the investment,NEGATIVE,1,0.9934569,17-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,The game is very slow to play. The worker walks slowly around the store  you have 1 million jobs to complete for 1 sale & can never keep up w orders. Constant upgrades are needed which feels like you never achieve anything. Pointless aspects like creating a HR office  yet you're the only person working there! The method of walking around the store (moving your finger over the screen to guide) hides the game & would work better if you could click where to go. Deleting after 5mins of play.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999788225,25-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,It's an ad farm. Back to back ads  or pay money. You'll spend more time watching ads than playing. Worse  when you choose to watch an ad for an extra worker or something  sometimes it won't work. But you better believe the ad they shove in there loads  no problem. And worst  it's buggy. It's not unusual for the game to hang up so badly you have to restart to get it going. Of course  you get to view another ad when you reload. Even amongst these type of games  there are better ones.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999489307,17-Mar-24
Pizza Ready!,really enjoying the game at the moment. the ADS are annoying if want to avoid this just turn off your WiFi and Internet Data and won't get ADS unless you level up or move location. the other annoying thing is walking pass the trash (Bin) and it gets rid of your products like why!? you don't waste food lol. apart from that quite addictive. Worth a try,POSITIVE,0,0.977889061,5-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,Game is fun & builds up overtime so it feels rewarding! I like the option to watch ads to gain rewards. It's frustrating that ads pop up w/o me choosing them in addition to the others I watched & I watched a lot. I couldn't go a full 2 minutes b4 another ad would start playing and I couldn't close it out. I also noticed lots of ads for sexual and fantasy games  which is nothing similar to this game and honestly frustrating. Little kids could be playing this & I don't wanna see that. Uninstalled.,NEGATIVE,1,0.697763264,27-Mar-24
Pizza Ready!,This game is nice and can actually be a good pass time but don't bother getting it unless you like watching ads every 10 seconds  every action on this game requires watching an ad to progress  and your only way out is to pay to remove the ads. I don't mind occasional ads but this game takes it to a whole other level so yeah take my word and save your time for other games that can more normally spam you with ads.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99604696,26-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,It's a fun simulation game  and pretty realistic  but there are many ads and I hate to say this  but the trash can. THE REVIEWS WERE TRUE!!! I'm warning you  if you try to go to the pick up area with pizzas the trash can gets in the way. Also  the speed annoys me. I would give it three and a half but I'll leave four. ð«¥,POSITIVE,0,0.941324353,22-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,Do you like ads??? Cause if you do this is the game for you. Players move incredibly slow at first until  you guessed it  you upgrade with an ad. Then after the ad  you get another every 3 to 4 minutes of gameplay. Level 11 seems to be the top right now and that is doable in about a day. Overall  meh... Cool game but the ads just kill it. However they are bypassed of played on airplane mode unless you're upgrading.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999238849,2-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,great game  i got to the tacos still playing  it's cool that you can upgrade quick watching ads. the traffic on the drivethrough sometimes glitches and the cars move back and forth with no eventual progress  which delays the stack of pizza boxes from reducing  and 2 or 3 of the employees get stuck holding stacks of these boxes to refill the spot but can't cz of the height limit  while the traffic isn't moving  i restart the game to fix it. Sorry for the long review. great work,NEGATIVE,1,0.993406057,23-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,This is no longer a game with ads. This is an advertisement with a game. You'll spend more time staring at an unskippable ad pop up  and with no exaggeration for every minute of gameplay. This is putting the  intrusive ads  to another dimension. Might as well make half of the screen constanly play ads. That way it's a better experience than getting kicked out every minute.,NEGATIVE,1,0.991300166,20-Mar-24
Pizza Ready!,I was really enjoying the game so I paid to remove the ads. Area 1 has excellent areas that are unique. Area 2 is just the same resturant 3 times over with no challenge or originality. Area 3 has 1 resturant and then the game is over. I've been playing for less than the past weekend and I'm done the game. It was fun but it definitely wasn't worth paying actual money to remove the ads in. I was expecting more than 7 levels  4 of which are the same. Disappointing as a whole.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996996164,10-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,Simple addicting pizza simulator to pass the time. Although  it's a low designed game  I like it...but it's has too many random ads that cuts in-between your leisure time of waiting. The random ad pop-ups gets quite annoying the longer you play in one sitting. Due to those ads  I just uninstalled it because I felt like I watched more ads than play the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999428093,6-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,Great game BUT... I was silly enough to buy no ads forever (nice that you got at least that one clear) but it was not clear that I will still be watching 30-45sec ads when upgrading. It would MAYBE be Ok if the ads are 5-10sec. Was furious when I discovered it was just to remove those ads you get in the middle of playing. Could you please make it so if a person spends money on it  then make the upgrades cost game money. Just no ads!,NEGATIVE,1,0.998869479,23-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,Nice game! But I have a problem; I'm at the third restaurant which is taco bell at level 9 and can't seem to find what I should upgrade to get higher; I'm keeping on looking around for that square money to pay beside all tables and machines. Can't find any  Seems like it could be a lag? What do I do to fix that???? I love the game and I wanna continue playing,NEGATIVE,1,0.996393263,29-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,Great game fun and awesome experience and many fun opportunities to have an amazing time but  there are always random things popping up on your screen to buy stuff and adds will pop up and inconvenient times other than that it is one of the best games I've ever played I really enjoy it and you don't even need wifi to play which is perfect for long car rides and is a perfect game and that's all bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Â¡,POSITIVE,0,0.999811113,22-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,The game was kinda fun at first  but quickly gets old. Also  the adds are absurd  I got close to 30 seconds of adds for about every 45 seconds of playing. Most of the adds LOOK like they can be skipped or closed early  but can't be. Also  adds permanently cover the bottom phone bar  so when I try to click home I open up some random add thats looks super scammy - I'm seriously cincerned about my cyber security due to this game. I do not recommend this game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999200404,21-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,Game play is right on  fun  entertaining  easy controls. Could be relaxing. But an add every 5-10 seconds literally  not exaggerating  is absolutely ridiculous. I think the longest I have went without an ad yet is 60 seconds once. How can I be expected to spend money on a game I can't enjoy to begin with? As long as people have complained about ads in games I cannot understand why it would be made worse rather than better whether it is the developer or the platform provider. It's ridiculous.,NEGATIVE,1,0.948110759,22-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,It's overall a good concept  but the ads are the worst thing ever. I made a stopwatch after watching an ad  after 1 minute 30 seconds there was the next one. It's unbelievable. The whole game is an ad with a game in it that you can sometimes play. You have to watch for this  that  everything. The ads are also very sexual and thinking about how innocent the game is  that a lot of kids will probably play this game  is unacceptable. Uninstalled after a few days.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999448001,31-Mar-24
Pizza Ready!,Every 1 minute of gameplay  you will be forced to watch a 15-30 second ad. Unfortunate really  as the game itself is enjoyable to play and I feel would get more play time out of me if there were less ads. I feel like I can barely progress because I'm stuck watching videos all the time. It's fine that you have the options to watch videos for power ups and more money but I don't even want to watch them because you are already feeding me with so many ads just to play the game. 5 star if less ads.,NEGATIVE,1,0.993882298,4-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,Fun game TERRIBLE WITH ADS It's a fun game and I'd be willing to play it but is almost unplayable with the pop up ads. You get a pop-up about every minute or two and they aren't short plus some automatically open the app store so you consistently going back to the game. I'm willing to watch ads for power ups but even after you watch one for a power up you still get an automatic ad after.,NEGATIVE,1,0.951372147,10-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,Very glitchy. Had to give it one star. Constant adverts. If you watch too many adverts  the game freezes  so you can turn the game off and on. But this loses your reward for watching the advert in full. So you have to watch another advert to get the reward back. very slow progression. And no instructions on how to get to level 3. It seems like the game is just a con to get you to watch adverts  so they get paid! An advert every 60 seconds after already watching 1 for rewards is just too much!!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999806941,9-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,Game is terrible. There are ads for me ever 5-10 seconds at the most. I am only playing to get credit for a different website and for some reason I'm stuck on the 3rd restaurant on level 1 for several days now and I play through out most of the day trying to get past it. Guess I won't be getting the full credit I deserve. There is no IT and/or contact person to help  not even information on how to help lvl up in the game. Unlike some I refuse to give the IT people any $$ on this sucky game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99973923,14-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,If you're into Tycoon games this would be a good surprisingly addictive game. I do have one complaint; the French Pizza Hat has its stations and garbage bin too close to each other. I keep accidentally tossing food in the trash. Or placing ready food in stations I do not intend to. If I walk straight from the fryer to either the dine in or dine out stations  it's a guess where my food will go towards. If I take the long way there's a good chance I will accidentally toss it in the garbage.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996515036,19-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,Addicted to the game. Paid to for ad free. 30 second videos to upgrade is ridiculous but I deal with it. New videos besides mistplay would be nice. However my 1 star review is due to me spending so much of the money earned to upgrade zones and sit and watch the stupid videos only for it to freeze after I've watched the video or mid video & I've wasted my money & no upgrade.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998424411,24-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,This game has a LOT of bugs and it's really annoying  I can't play it. Like sometimes the driveway bugs out and it slows down the moneymaking but most frequently I CAN'T WALK. Even when I reopen the app my character is having a seizure and can't walk for some reason. It's really REEEALLY annoying. Anyways  the game itself is OK  pretty fun to play but the bugs are just ruining my experience.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998433292,9-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,I like the idea of the game  and it's fun (way to many ads  play it in airplane mode). But I got to 7 restaurants  completely maxed out every single one  and now that's it. No new restaurants  just collecting money... for no reason I guess. Off to find a new game ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.994446039,16-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,The game is very repetitive as every restaurant you open repeats the same formula just w slightly different graphics. My main gripe is the constant pop-up ads  approx every 30 seconds they appear. Really annoying and very expensive to remove. I deleted the game within a few days of gameplay due to this.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999772966,25-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,Good game if you have an ad blocker. I have PiHole running at home so I never saw any ads. This also means the optional  watch to earn X reward  feature doesn't work if you are looking for shortcuts. That are 7 restaurants you start up and took 10 hours to beat the game. Overall it was enjoyable. The character control pauses briefly when an ad tries to play on its own so I was able to see how often they would have played and it's honestly disgusting. So either pay to remove ads or block them.,POSITIVE,0,0.602441967,22-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,I like that it's basically everything you'd be doing if you actually worked there. all the way down to taking everything to the trash  cleaning tables  and taking a break as well. maybe make it to where we can move along a little quicker but still not bad. graphics are fine  game is fun  easily 5 stars. thanks developers!,POSITIVE,0,0.999807656,8-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,It's not so much a game as it is an ad generator. Lots of ads. Every time u touch the screen ads. It's nice to be able to watch an ad for a free item but you can't even play the game without ads popping up. There are a lot of ads. Ads advertised through every click. Lots of ads. This is not a game it's just ads. Want to make some pizza? Don't do it here it's just ads. They have ads a lot. There are ads everywhere in this ad generator. Not an actual game just ads ads an Unacceptable amount. Ads,NEGATIVE,1,0.999568045,27-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,I really like this game. I find it intertaining. I saw it in an add and it was good to download it. The only annoying or difficulty about this was how there are many adds. Every time I walk about and the the max of 6 things an add apers. At least I can skip theoughr the adds  it not those long ones either. The good thing about the adds is that they are short so it's not crazy annoying that on order to get cool upgrade like gloves you need an add. I really like this game. Just it could stop adds,POSITIVE,0,0.993106782,26-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,My only problem is u can't play the game for a commercial cutting in constantly other than that I like the game I've been trying to play this again today and about every minute there is a commercial how can u play a game line that.

Pizza Ready!,Game is quite good but there are two main reason that I didn't like this game too much... First one is that there too much ads after every few seconds... Second one is that there are many glitches in this game after the 2nd level..when I was playing there was a glitch that make the game a black screen and I have to restart it..but the problem didn't solved there was also glitch remained after restarting the multiples time.. Beside this the game is intresting and enjoy to play...ð¤,NEGATIVE,1,0.710126698,23-Apr-24

Pizza Ready!,In beginning it was great. As soon as level increases number of ads also increases. You can't upgrade anything without watching ads. And ads are almost 30-40seconds long. I calculated. I wasted 4-5 hours on ads. When i realized this. I uninstalled the game. This game is wastage of time seriously.,NEGATIVE,1,0.989090145,25-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,Has potential. It really does. The pure number of aggressive ads is mind-boggling. Not even a honeymoon phase. Take those ads down about 50% and it would be fun. Even the optional reward ads are aggressive. I get it. They need to make money. I'd buy the ads free  but would like to know if I like the game before purchasing.,POSITIVE,0,0.829057932,25-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,Its not like the advertised pre-downloaded game. I still wanted to play  big mistake  The ads and pop ups in this are insanely high  can't even finish a level or a task without multiple ads. It's not even as good as the pre downloaded version. ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.999772251,19-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,It was fun at first to get several minutes of gameplay before an ad. After that it's maybe every minute ish. It's completely loaded with ads making it annoying. The game is fun. Reduce ads and I may consider downloading it again. But for now nope I'm done,NEGATIVE,1,0.990778446,22-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,The game would be good if there wasn't an ad every 30 seconds. I can understand watching ads to get upgrades and that sort of thing. In this game you will watch an ad then start walking then another ad comes right away. It takes away from the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995280266,22-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,Difficult enough to grasp and get the character to move properly without having to have an ad every 30 seconds. Took any fun the game might have been right out. I gave it two stars because the game was fun but the ads were an extreme annoyance,NEGATIVE,1,0.997783005,28-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,I liked this game so much xozy of the type of progression in.....but this was one of the worst coz of 1 minute gap pop up ads....we can't play it for one minute straight coz of ads popup and wasting 10-20 seconds in every minute... devs are hunger for earning money through ads... that's why they did this dirty 1 minutes ads.. If it was okay if we want the watch ad that include with a reward but this pop up ads is so irritating and that's why gonna uninstall with in utter disappointment...,NEGATIVE,1,0.999740422,17-Apr-24

I guess it was just because I was having a whole ton of fun!!!! I really recommend buying this. i was actually playing a different game and an ad for this came on  and I started playing it  and i thought to myself    I'ma get this. so if youryou'rll having trouble deciding to get this game  heres your answer yesssssssss it's a very pleasing gameð ð ð âºï¸,POSITIVE,0,0.998348713,26-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,I understand that games need ads in order for it to run...but too many ads is just plain greedy. I have no problem with ads just like any other games that I play but it gets annoying when it pops out every 30 seconds....for that I'm uninstalling,NEGATIVE,1,0.998120129,27-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,I would absolutely love this game if you would space the ads out. If it was every 10 minutes that would be better but preferably every 20 minutes. Currently there is an ad every single minute And sometimes it's twice a minute.,NEGATIVE,1,0.847135305,19-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,Very playable on âï¸ï¸ mode. I was enjoying it up to Pizza Hat in France. Money isn't transferrable. I think there should be some tranfer. And it feels much slower in France. Not to mention there's no rewards in France yet so you don't get money for leveling up. I think France shouldn't be available if it's not finished.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997353554,25-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,game seem fun if you don't mind ads   literally will spend more time watching ads then playing the game . even if you don't get any of the  upgrades ( getting an upgrade you will be required to watch an ad ) an ad will just pop up during normal game play ..,POSITIVE,0,0.883619308,19-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,the game is very addictive but when you start on second shop the ads are just too much. forced ads pop up every minute. and purchase for no more ads is over the top  6 dollars weekly! just end up deleting the game...,NEGATIVE,1,0.99959439,19-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,Ads! If it wasn't for the unannounced ones popping up every 1 minute I'd still have this game.

Please let me know when they are taken out  I'll reinstall :),NEGATIVE,1,0.926865876,9-Apr-24
Pizza Ready!,Great addictive game  however after paying for the game and then only finding out there is a maximum of 7 levels. I really do hope the creators add more levels as I do not feel paying for the game is worth it's money,POSITIVE,0,0.99543792,27-Apr-24

Pizza Ready!,Game could be fun but waaaayyyy to many ads. I understand an ad to speed something up or to enhance something but just out of the blue  an ad pop up is ridiculous and just not good business to keep ppl interested in the game. Keep in mind only a small number of people are going to pay to play and remove ads  the rest just want a fun free game to escape from reality. Also you and every other game creator needs to cut their adds down from 30 seconds to more like 10 secs to keep ppl interested,NEGATIVE,1,0.999098659,13-Apr-24
Hill Climb Racing,I re-downloaded this game after 6-7 months and lost ALL of my progress. I had signed in with Google play games before and all my data was saved but when I re-downloaded it and tried to sign in and I didn't get my progress back. I had bought several cars and maps and made significant progress in the garage and now its all gone. Please fix this glitch quickly. Other than that it is a pretty good game. Please take care of the sign in issue ASAP.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995773971,15-Mar-20
Hill Climb Racing,For people complaining about ads  you can experience the entire game without being connected to the Internet  meaning you get 0 ads. It's the perfect game for public spaces like restaurants. It can be played for well over an hour or two while you wait for food. It's kept me entertained for years because of how much there is to mess around with. My only complaint is some of the more modern additions like the lootboxes  but they don't even become better than real upgraded cars thankfully.,POSITIVE,0,0.994570792,3-Apr-24
Hill Climb Racing,Developer  there is an issue in settings that I wish you would do something about. Every time that I open up the game and begin playing all my preferences in settings stay the same except for the pedals. I have to exit  turn off the pedal view because that's my preference. Every other setting stays where I put them except pedals. Why ? Can you please fix this issue so that all preferences remain in the setting position placed. It would be greatly appreciated. âï¸,NEGATIVE,1,0.99765861,5-Mar-24
Hill Climb Racing,If I'm being honest this was a great game for all. Remember when we would lie in our bed and play this game for hours  but now it may still have value with new cars and upcoming updates  however they are not worth it. Just to begin with the ads  it's like every other time i lose boom add and if i say no to double coins I STILL GET A ADD. I love this game and we all do but i can play a game with that many adds. Some adds are fine but it's just too much now. To end off  the updates are lazy.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997015119,22-Mar-24
Hill Climb Racing,After a couple months when I reinstalled the game it shows that vehicles and stages are locked even though I already purchased it with real money.

I recommend any player for not purchaseing anything in game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997712016,1-Apr-24
Hill Climb Racing,I love the game though but there are a lot of improvements to be made. The User interface have been the same over decades  please make some changes. Also all the stages have same music exclude the Neon and Ragnokk. The night stage should have background music like a summer night or cicada noise.At least all the stages are different and they should all have different music and noise. Please provide a wardrobe for bill to change his outfit.also let us to customize the music and sound volume.,POSITIVE,0,0.819424152,26-Feb-24
Hill Climb Racing,Just one of those games where the more you play it the less fun it gets. Fun to cruise around in  but once you get far into a map it just becomes rng for whether you'll hit a weird bounce or you'll have to make a blind jump due to needing momentum to get over something.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996863961,29-Feb-24
Hill Climb Racing,Its fun but every two runs/tries you get a 30 second ad. And they taunt you with it  saying  Tired of ads? Just spend your whole life savings on some dlc you don't need.

Hill Climb Racing,So uuu... This post was made in 25.2.24 if you red this sooner  the contest for a map to win just SUCKS. How about just add those maps into this update  children could play this game and want one of those races to win and they can't check discord because too young  and if the race they selected didn't win  well you are going to get a bad rating  like how about just add those tracks instead  not a contest.

Hill Climb Racing,This game was great for many years now you can't even exit a level without being hit with an ad  Pro tip completely closing the app and restarting is 4 times faster than even watching 1 of the ads (each is about 3 minutes long and you can't skip it 2/10 considering all of the above and the fact ads are as frequent as every 2nd stage you enter.

Hill Climb Racing,The the sum of the price in diamonds at the moment I buy boosters  is wrong  you have to fix that because if the price of 1 item is 30 diamonds  then 2 items should be 60 diamonds not 90  and if I buy 3 items the total sum should be 90 not 180. The balance of the vehicles are wrong  after accelerating  the front part is very light  should be more balanced  a little bit more heavy to make the tires have more grip. The daily challenge: hit 5 skeleton in 1 run  isn't working.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999743521,11-Feb-24
Hill Climb Racing,I thought that this was going to be a decent childhood remembrance but now that I've grown I just realized how god awful it is. Everything is expensive as hell and the odds of the daily challenges are always stacked against you. A piss poor method of encouraging others to purchase gems. I don't understand the point in upgrading your grip when the vehicle always tips backwards on steep ascents. And if it has max power it tips over faster. Just another greedy cash grab. 1 star.

And of course all of them move your aimer if you touch the screen accidentally. So ya gotta take your time and pay attention. Bcuz it'll bump shot off.

Pooking - Billiards City,For the love of God  stop showing me gross ads that I can't click out of! The basic game is fine  but these ads are getting increasingly obnoxious. Some require clicking an x as much as 5 times  but lately I'm getting gross sex ads that are impossible to click out of. It's disgusting. I would have paid a one time fee to get rid of them  but the only option offered was a monthly subscription of some ridiculous amount. It was clearly not worth the price.

Pooking - Billiards City,One of the best single player games I have played. It is very relaxing and has several levels. What makes it stressful is the ads you see at the end of every single level  or if you retry a level. It just gets exhausting to have to click out of so many ads.

It's relaxing  challenging  and fun. It gets more difficult as you progress  but not to the point that you can't complete the game.

Pooking - Billiards City,Good game overall. Good physics  etcetera. My problem is I've gotten to level 360  and there hasn't been one regular pool game to play.

Not having a regular game to play or if you have to level up extremely high to unlock it is a drawback for me. Despite this  I enjoy playing the game.,POSITIVE,0,0.85092032,7-Jan-24

Case in point no matter if you use English or not rail shots experience a slow down mid rail whether touching the rail or not and it skews shots to miss or choke when they shouldn't.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998078585,15-Feb-24

Pooking - Billiards City,I used to love this game. It was one of the best snooker games. But this last update doesn't feel as real. The physics should return back to what it was. Especially when the ball hits the rail  it's speed reduces by a great magnitude.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996343672,12-Mar-24

Pooking - Billiards City,Game is nice and calm Quick to load and open on Google Pixel 7 Pro. But after over 60 levels  grt's boring  no real unlocks  city repeats. It would be good to actually build your city or choose city scapes with your crowns and winnings. Guides and help should also be unlockables so the more you advance  the better your aiming. Cues should also offer special skills like extra hearts or 1 allowed mistake for crown. Game just gets boring because there's nothing else than playing puzzles for crowns,NEGATIVE,1,0.996788502,26-Nov-23

Pooking - Billiards City,Very nice game  but just I suggest that there should be multiplayer option for games and also pool maps in that option. Should go for it...very nice game!

Pooking - Billiards City,Nice chill game to play when you have some down time. It's not going to be the most riveting gameplay  because it's all pool so there's only so much variation you can get. It does have enough different table shapes and ball formations to provide a little variety. There are ads between each round  but they're almost all short  like 5-10 seconds  which I appreciate.,NEGATIVE,1,0.842349827,6-Dec-23

Pooking - Billiards City,I really did like this game but now the number of ads like after every single frame which cannot be easily and swiftly closed has become intolerable. Some frames have frozen necessitating a restart. Sometimes the balls hug the cushions regardless of how they are hit. Often multiple taps needed to close an ad. More time watching ads than playing. If I could pay to remove ads I'd pay to continue but I can't. Note the lack of response by the developer to criticism. Uninstalling.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99886632,5-Nov-23

Pooking - Billiards City,Was easy at first but as you advance the holes get harder to get into and shooting strength varies.

Pooking - Billiards City,Had this game for years and loved it.

Pooking - Billiards City,I like this game  but I was wondering if there is an option to change the viewing angle for the table. Also is there any bigger tables.

Pooking - Billiards City,Too many ads spoils a decent game. I understand you need to make money. However  you have a banner that runs at the bottom the entire time. Then you have an ad after EVERY single game. It's just too much.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999690413,30-Dec-23

Pooking - Billiards City,I am at level 328. This is for everyone who just started. This game is not going to keep you playing for long. Its good and interesting at the beginning but for a game with no opponent  it becomes tasteless after a while  especially when you start repeating boards you have already played. Also  the only accomplishment which is the sticks you keep releasing as you progress  is questionable. Nothing at all shows that the sticks add any improvement to your gameplay. I still hit the ball same way.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998367727,5-May-19
Real Car Driving: Race City 3D,I downloaded it and had to watch 2 ads before the game even loaded for the first time. Needless to say  I didn't even see the home screen - I uninstalled on the 2nd ad. Edit since the reply: Nah  there's a difference between putting ads in a game strategically & forcing someone to watch ads  especially when just downloading the game. Like I said  I never even got to play the game or see the home screen before forcefully watching 2 ads. It doesn't take a genius to realize that's a terrible idea,NEGATIVE,1,0.999518514,10-Dec-23
Real Car Driving: Race City 3D,This is the worst car game I've ever installed. There's nothing wrong with the graphics or game itself besides the fact that there's an ad every 10 seconds. I can't even properly play the game without my wifi and data turned off because of the number of ads. Even with them off  the amount of times I have to watch an ad to get something (for example) I earned in the app like a tire is insane. I found it weird and difficult that the game has no gearshift  or at least I didn't see one (no tutotial),NEGATIVE,1,0.999779761,22-Mar-24
Real Car Driving: Race City 3D,An ideal driving simulator game should prioritize player experience by providing a larger map for exploration  interactive elements  customization options  and reducing the number of intrusive advertisements. To achieve this  developers can implement non-intrusive ad placement  opt-out options  reward-based ads  and prioritize quality over quantity. By focusing on these aspects  players can enjoy a more immersive and engaging driving simulation experience. Which the game only partly does. ð,POSITIVE,0,0.975051045,15-Apr-24
Real Car Driving: Race City 3D,Started playing  10 seconds down the road... 30 second ad... another 30 seconds down the road... the same 30 second ad... that's pretty much how it went for 5 minutes before I came here to write this and uninstall this game. Oh and it's absolutely nothing like the ad for this game. It doesn't have the great graphics or the real engine sounds as shown in the ad. Don't bother downloading this game if that's what your expecting. Oh and the handling... What a joke... Honestly... Don't bother,NEGATIVE,1,0.999314547,8-Feb-24
Real Car Driving: Race City 3D,The game itself as in the controls and concept is good. However it gives you choices of paying or watching an ad at certain point in the game.

Real Car Driving: Race City 3D,A lot of reviews on Google Play overly complain about ads... So I always try them out for myself and then decide. There are some games that only have a few ads  and then the game gets roasted for it in reviews. These people are out of touch with the reality of capitalism. However  this game is absolutely ridiculously infested with ads  and it doesn't go through any guidance on game play at the beginning  leaving you at a bit of a loss as to what the specifics of the game is.

Real Car Driving: Race City 3D,The worst car game I've downloaded.

Real Car Driving: Race City 3D,Best game ever found on playstore  game graphics  FX  music  controls etc to be honest everything about the game is superb! But my little problem is if you guys can add or expand the city and add something like a long broad high way  I think it would be more adorable  like I just go around the city like  marry go round  and no where to go again but I think with the high way and enough more buildings and streets  the game will be more enjoyable   THANK YOU ,POSITIVE,0,0.999456108,29-Nov-23

Real Car Driving: Race City 3D,I'm only giving you one star because it's graphics and quality are suburb but the ads issues is out of this world and very uncomfortable and irritating at same time that one has no control over the game you should take this seriously I once bump into a police car because of the ads and guess what it resulted to !a RAMPAGE also the side mirrors are blind,NEGATIVE,1,0.999697804,25-Mar-24

Real Car Driving: Race City 3D,Everyone says  we need to use ads to keep the game free  but excessive amounts will just make everyone delete and give a bad review. I had to watch 2 ads before the game even started to the home screen and then after playing for less then 10 seconds another ad started. Free games use ads to aid in their cost but this is ridiculous.

Checked the game and it is just a freedrive in a small  empty city with just a few poorly  designed  buildings  forced ad banner on the bottom and forced non-skippable fullscreen ads. 2 stars just because there is  something  but it's far from being realistic or at least from mimicking the games they use gameplay of.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999455392,11-Dec-23
Real Car Driving: Race City 3D,The game is... Okay... Physics-wise its ehh...

Real Car Driving: Race City 3D,I think it would be a great game but everyone else is upset about ads  that doesn't bother me so much  but the face is that there's no way to know what the map looks like or what type of events  there's not even a tutorial or a legend of what to do and when you come up on an event it doesn't give you time to get out of it before it throws you into it  this game is pretty confusing and I am lost with a lot of it  it's a disappointment for me  I hope you add in more directions  not deleting yet,NEGATIVE,1,0.999366701,10-Dec-23

Real Car Driving: Race City 3D,This is a new level of ads in this game (before  mid and after each race) I'm shocked this game is rated over 4.

8 Ball Pool,This game is one of the best I've ever played  but it's been causing some issues since yesterday. My phone freezes and restarts automatically while playing  and I even lost a game worth 10 million points! The constant restarts are frustrating  and I'm worried about losing my progress. I'm considering reaching out to the game's support team or seeking help from a professional repair service to fix the issue.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998390317,29-Apr-24
8 Ball Pool,hello there 8 ball team! It is an amazing game but if you add a spectator feature in different modes like tournaments  It will make it more enjoyable.because sometimes in tournaments we have to wait for our opponent to win the game and then play with us  and in that time there should be a spectator mode so we can watch our opponent's game. thanks,POSITIVE,0,0.996961892,8-Apr-24
8 Ball Pool,I've only been playing for a couple of days but so far  so good. There's not too many ads unless you WANT to watch them to gain rewards. I lost a game because I was trying to aim but I was too close to the shot meter and it forced my shot while still trying to aim. So I've missed a couple of shots because I unexpectedly hit the cue ball before I was ready... other than that the physics seem very solid! I will continue to play until it forces me to spend money or watch too many ads.,NEGATIVE,1,0.992869556,8-Apr-24
8 Ball Pool,It's very fun game to play and very challenging specially playing with a seasoned player on my very first game  I did not expect that. The screen is so confusing for time user of the App and the stick is difficult to aim to the intended target. I could not execute any controlling english shot on the cue ball nor ! back spin  I guess had not figure it out yet for being new user of the site. Other than that it is a fun game to play. It is getting very interesting as I further explore.,POSITIVE,0,0.996662796,20-Feb-24
8 Ball Pool,As an actual league player  it can be frustrating how inaccurate certain things are. The way it's set up  there's little to no skill involved. I understand there are cues that will perform better than others  but even with a cue that is almost maxed on everything  putting english on the cue ball doesn't function properly  which really screws with bank shots  and ball speed barely plays a part outside of leaves. The game can still be fun once you figure out proper ball speeds.,NEGATIVE,1,0.925535858,8-Feb-24
8 Ball Pool,It's a great game BUT there is a huge paywall which makes playing extremely unenjoyable. Even if you buy things here and there the tier system does not make it worth it. The payout for the wheels are not even close to worth it. But  if you can get past the constant barrage of prompts for purchases and get to the game it's great. Smooth play system  cues can be upgraded (it could be better if you got to choose which upgrades)  and the types of games you can play are decent.,POSITIVE,0,0.988538504,14-Feb-24
8 Ball Pool,The game is really fun  and I do enjoy it a lot. I wish it could be a 5 out of 5  but I'm knocking 2 stars away; here's why There are times in which the game is very smooth. You're able to place your shoot very accordingly  however if you want a smooth experience  you must play this game at a specific time frame because there have been times when the game is suddenly very glitchy  moving your finger but the stick don't move till far enough  it jumps  and refuse to be accurate. It's annoying.,NEGATIVE,1,0.91175288,12-Mar-24
8 Ball Pool,It's a fun game and it gives me joy SOMETIMES. But most of the time  I'll be up against people ranked 4-5 times than me especially in 9 ball. In the main 1v1  the enemies have almost perfect aim to the point that they look like bots. Please fix this issue because it's just so unmotivating to see your opponent be like super strong while your just sitting there  wondering when it'll be your turn.,NEGATIVE,1,0.970988989,8-Mar-24
8 Ball Pool,First week of returning to play  and I'm glad returned. As this is a mobile game  it is par for the course in that pop-ups won't quit at all. It's very annoying to be interrupted as often as I have been. I â¤ï¸ the cue sticks' unique characteristics. I played this actual game many years ago  and there were fewer rewards  modes  and features; it is nice to return to play such a well-made game that has continued development.,POSITIVE,0,0.990748107,16-Feb-24
8 Ball Pool, 8 Ball Pool  is an absolute delight for anyone who enjoys a thrilling game of billiards from the comfort of their own device. With its intuitive controls  realistic physics  and variety of game modes  it's easy to lose track of time while sinking shots and outmaneuvering opponents. Whether you're a casual player looking for a quick match or a seasoned pro aiming for the top of the leaderboard   8 Ball Pool  offers endless entertainment and challenges. With regular updates.,POSITIVE,0,0.999548018,9-Mar-24
8 Ball Pool,Very buggy. Tap a ball and the cue travels the entire length of the table and you scratch. Adding spin in the direction you want and it goes whichever way it wants. Try to play a game and the opponent somehow locks the game to where you can't do anything. Rewards are pretty trash as well. Some opponents can make shots that are blatantly impossible yet you can't make the simplest shot.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996947825,8-Feb-24
8 Ball Pool,I absolutely love playing 8 Ball Pool  but let me tell you  that matchmaking system can be a real pain sometimes. It's like I always end up facing off against these super experienced players who seem to have mastered every trick shot. And you can probably guess what happens next... Yep  a whole lot of losses! It can be pretty frustrating  to say the least. I hope the developers can improve thr matchmaking,NEGATIVE,1,0.996585965,17-Mar-24
8 Ball Pool,Like it but... Dropped my rating again because now it has a pop-up ad that comes up constantly. I keep hitting it because it is nearly a full screen and it pops up when I try to click to play. Last downgrade was because during high use times I get network disconnect messages. Not on my side  my network is solid on fiber. My theory is the servers are overloaded. I've lost too many games because of this issue. Grandson  son  and my other close friends quit playing because of this. Fix it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998425961,7-Feb-24
8 Ball Pool,Very upsetting  I had a few million coins when the dang game started glitching  I would make a shot and the game would glitch and you could clearly see that the shot went in but the screen would flÃ sh and the balls would be right back like they were before I shot. And the opponent would have ball in hand. Then for some ungodly reason the game restarted and almost all of my coins were gone!!!!! There should be some way to get them back since it was the game that took them. About ready to delete!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999425292,13-Apr-24
8 Ball Pool,Let's not talk about the graphics. Graphics is excellent but the physics & glitches of the game is just awful. Firstly  let's talk about the aim. Aiming was precise when i was playing and i even checked ensuring it will enter the hole but unexpectedly it didn't. Secondly  movement/physics of the ball. Thirdly  majority of the opponents are hackers. Overall  eventhough you've mastered the game. It still won't let you win...what a letdown...so do something about it to obtain better reviews/likes.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998840868,22-Apr-24
8 Ball Pool,Too many cues. One simple cue with ability to upgrade would be fine. Also the game options for 9-ball is better. You can choose any wager with the option to call the pockets or not. 8 ball games limit you to what they feel is best. Want to play a $5k game and call all shots  nope  not available. But you can with 9 ball. The options should be the same for both tables. Software is horrible can predict with 100% accuracy when cue ball will scratch to give opponent advantage.,NEGATIVE,1,0.98906076,27-Feb-24
8 Ball Pool,I've downloaded and played this on several devices. Just recently received a new tablet. However the game will install and even show the opening loading screen but crashes every single time. I've tried restarting my device  tried uninstalling and reinstalled and still it just crashes in the middle of the opening load. Please help. I've also cleared cache and storage  changed permissions. It will start but never makes it past initial load screen.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999557316,13-Apr-24
8 Ball Pool,I've played this game for about 9 years now and enjoyed every second of it  I have multiple (if not all) of the legendary cues  I love the tournaments and the constantly dynamic special events and event cues that can be earned by playing in the window of time that they are available. All of these features and many more I have thoroughly been impressed by  up until about two weeks ago when I experienced an issue that is incredibly infuriating and makes me not want to ever play this game again.,POSITIVE,0,0.994990051,16-Mar-24
8 Ball Pool,This platform was great! There were so many opportunities to show off the many styles and different games of billiards. Unfortunately  the development sold out  and now all you have is new side games and childish graphics. What a shame. This game could have helped bring some of the youth back into the sport of billiards. Instead  you have a money hungry algorithm that rewards the people who spend money in the game. The opportunities lost are the saddest part of this.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999584258,7-Apr-24
8 Ball Pool,This game has heavy connection issues. I have made shots and waited for the game to let me take my next shot only for the game to take back my shot and make me redo the whole thing without resetting the shot clock. I have had multiple games lost because I made a shot then got reset with only 2 seconds on the clock! This game is trash!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999597728,27-Apr-24
8 Ball Pool,Had to delete this game for some reasons. 8 Ball Pool suffers from several gameplay issues that detract from the overall experience. Notably  the game's handling of lag creates an unfair advantage  with opponents' timers stopping while the player's(mine) continues  leading to frustration. Additionally  the seemingly perfect accuracy of opponents  even when the shot line is obstructed  undermines the fairness of gameplay.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999670148,6-Apr-24
8 Ball Pool,Great game but I think it's kinda rigged. I'm not saying this just because I kept losing or something but as I was reading the other reviews they have the similar problem with me. Whenever it's my turn to shoot the 8 ball it's either not gonna shoot even if my speed and position is correct or the cue ball will just shoot after the black one which is unfair because that rarely happens with my opponents. It's a GREAT game but it's just UNFAIR.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998910546,3-Mar-24
8 Ball Pool,Match making is very bias. I can lose 7 or 8 games in a row and still meet people with 10+ win streaks. You can only really win in big games if you're using the hacks that people use.. I'm not great at the game but it's very easy to detect when someone is cheating and it happens more often than not (in big games). This game is not fun it's annoying and I won't be wasting anymore time or money on there.,NEGATIVE,1,0.982492924,12-Apr-24
8 Ball Pool,Game is horribly rigged. In the beginning your cues have much better aim and will make seemingly impossible shots  but as your progress the same cues will struggle to aim on the easiest shots  even if you  recharge  the cue or upgrade it. It's also a borderline virtual casino where every conceivable feature is loaded with micro transactions  but you don't get anything back from the game besides frustration. What an unethical piece of garbage.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999715984,30-Mar-24
8 Ball Pool,It's awfully suspicious how I lose 4 or 5 straight matches (without a chance to break or even getting a turn as my opponent flawlessly runs the table) after purchasing some coins..almost like I'm getting paired with bots. Also suspicious is at times I seem to be playing on a frictionless surface while my opponent does not seem to be having that same problem. This game does all it can to make you spend money and it's just not worth it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999775112,1-Apr-24
8 Ball Pool,This game has everything you need to play 8 ball pool though it does have a minor disturbance for us players that doesn't spend real money for anything  and that is advertisements. This causes a bad experience not just for me  but also for others because it interrupts the amazing gameplay of players after every 2 games of any kind . Some even pops up once but has lots of follow ups which wants to force us to spend money on  remove ads or ad-free packs .,NEGATIVE,1,0.999257743,26-Mar-24
8 Ball Pool,As so many other reviews indicate  this game is absolutely 100% rigged. It will let you get ahead up to a point  but once you reach a certain level  forget it. The  surprise scratch   where the cue ball bounces off a rail  then off another rail  then off of a ball and right into a pocket? Get used to it  it will happen again and again. Getting snookered on the last ball? It will happen like clockwork. Folks at Miniclip are crooks with no shame. I stand by my previous review 1.5 yrs. ago. ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.991062403,11-Apr-24
8 Ball Pool,Nice game but really is rigged. My cue is never facing the correct direction as is the opponents. The cue whirls around till I get to see a shot then run out of time. I am often faced with opponents who clear the board from the get go. The opponents shots are always totally set up for them. I have to struggle. Something is wrong if not rigged.,NEGATIVE,1,0.988102853,8-Feb-24
8 Ball Pool,This game is totally unfair due to many reasons. If it's up to opponents' level   10 to 75 or 244 or higher. You never win high amounts on spin or scratch. Suddenly  touching on high amount matches make you start them without a second option to ask you for yes or not. Better cue  better shots  win game. Means with money you can win  not with talent. It's subjective for winning of some nations  which I do not want to mention the names.. for example:it helps them somehow to win.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998703718,27-Feb-24
8 Ball Pool,Very addictive game  it's been a very excellent experience. But I think that if the developers can actually establish a means of playing with other people or players from around the world and also creating a means of deposits and withdrawals  probably into the 8 pool wallet  you can risk out whatever amount you've deposited in agreement with other players to play  this would attract more people into the game and the app owners can make interest too from the stake.,NEGATIVE,1,0.982234657,8-Mar-24
8 Ball Pool,Deeply frustrating game to play on a phone. The controls regularly clash with each other  leading you to play a shot you hadn't intended. I think it is likely that I have lost many games as a result. Great... the  update  has left me unable to connect to the game.... I canon's guess (literally) what other  improvements  might be in store...,NEGATIVE,1,0.999124348,6-Feb-24
8 Ball Pool,The game is alright but always getting in-game ads every 5 minutes to buy cues and other offers and it's s getting old. If I want to buy something  I will buy. But this is driving me away from spending money w miniclip. Give it a rest. Also the club chat has a glitch. When you go to type somethomg in the chat window  it just disappears and then you have to start all over with out seeing what you're typing.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999372542,3-Mar-24
8 Ball Pool,Rubbish. Made up rules. Easy shots that are CLEARLY going in surprisingly miss?!? Can't play full power screw back as it makes it even more random. A lot of  opponents  obviously can't play but end up smashing random balls around and then beating you?!? And lots of pop-ups. Don't waste your time  there are much better options out there.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996930778,13-Mar-24
8 Ball Pool,There have been too many times recently having lined up my pot perfectly into the centre of the pocket  the ball has either wobbled in the jaws of the pocket or missed by a country mile...why?? Please fix ASAP. I wish there was a way you could sort your cues...by upgrade fee. It would really help. ð Also  why do you have to wait for your opponents response after virtually every shot  it's so annoying?,NEGATIVE,1,0.99944669,21-Mar-24
8 Ball Pool,the game itself is a blast! great graphics  smooth game play. my only issue  and it's a big one. This game is thirsty. I mean ads constantly. between every match  ad. if you close the ad  the purchase in game bucks opens automatically. and these aren't cheep $1.99 add ons  but as much as $20.-$70. purchases. ridiculous.,POSITIVE,0,0.744267702,24-Mar-24
8 Ball Pool,Okay  giving everybody a heads up. This app used to work fine. It is the only app I play where I will put money toward it. But lately  my team and I have been experiencing major technical issues. You click on one amount of coins to bet and another amount  always lower comes up. That means if you win that game you are denied the amount that you were willing to put up as a win. Also  in the last few months  when that started happening  our win percentages started to plummet. Smelling a scam.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99935168,25-Feb-24
8 Ball Pool,If you looking for making yourself frustrated  this is the perfect game for you. Ultra unrealistic gameplay  slow first break for me but somehow my opponent always potted 3-4 balls and then they will always shoot the rest of the balls like a sloth. They only shoot fast for some impossible shot  and oh I almost forgot  the white ball always attracted to the hole  seems like there is some kind of magnet attached. And you can always know if you going to lose the game. Great way to stress you out ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.952213764,15-Mar-24
8 Ball Pool,It was a decent game until the last week or so when it's become overrun with bots and cheats making ridiculous shots off three cushions and a deflection of two balls etc. The kind of thing no-one  no matter how good at gaming or pool could make. I tried contacting miniclip  they can't do anything. They won't reimburse your points total for any games against players found cheating. You just lose your money. Historically  customer service has been terrible. I wouldn't even bother.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999130428,24-Apr-24
8 Ball Pool,Spins are rigged... 99% of the time  you'll get 150 or lower. Games are rigged too; scratches happen often that are not physically [physics] possible  and opponents are unfairly matched. Multiple times I have built up millions of coins and then will hit a rash of loses that will take me back down to under 100K. I have never made an in-app purchase  maybe my outcomes would be different if I did. But  it's the only game of it's kind as far as I know.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998910189,13-Mar-24
8 Ball Pool,Don't play if you don't like unfairness  not only the level system is screwed  there are a lot of hackers or script users in the game. A lot of bugs too  one time i had this experience that one of the balls went in and came back out  and some balls hitting invisible things. Absolute trash in terms of leagues  they base your skill on your levels and the game is almost impossible to play when you are level 21+. Would NOT recommend to play at all.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999571264,1-Apr-24
8 Ball Pool,Ok Developers. Great game I really enjoy it . But it has some major flaws. I have multiple videos of my winning a match that the coins were removed from my account to play but when I won I did not receive the prize coins for winning. Started today at 3mill. Currently at 1100 bucks. Plus the unrealistic shots being made thru other balls so fast they cannot even be seen just the ball falling in the return chute. Need to fix this guys.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996191859,29-Feb-24
8 Ball Pool,Massive paywall  ok to waste some time  but dont expect to win alot if you dont spend actual money  it WILL set your opponent up to win  and you will be amazed at the perfection of some of their shots  youll win to start  the all of a sudden have a huge losing streak if you dont buy stuff  look at the reviews here  seems to have got worse recently! A note to add  had issues with rewards not paying out after videos  contacted customer support  their reply was basically  not our problem ,NEGATIVE,1,0.995334327,12-Mar-24
8 Ball Pool,It's definitely rigged against you if you don't spend real money. The pop-up ads seem like they're trying to get you to accidentally click on it. The app will disconnect when youre on the 8 ball  the computer will make you pot the cue ball  The mini games are also rigged against you to win as little as possible. All the other reviews say the same thing too. They want you to spend more and more money all the time to offset the amount of cheating happening,NEGATIVE,1,0.999579132,13-Feb-24
8 Ball Pool,Something wrong going on with my game. Since yesterday  in each and every game it seems like there are not the real people playing with me  unbelievable shots they play and win  more than 100 games I have lost and same thing happened in every game. Even straight shots are being played by tricks and the balls are being pocketed. Unbelievable things happening. Don't know what's wrong. I have screen recordings of many games  anybody who will watch  will say the opponent is not a real person.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998713732,17-Apr-24
8 Ball Pool,Not happy about the rate increase from 4 dollars for each mission to 4 dollars for the first mission  with an additional 2 dollars increase (instead of one!) for each succeeding mission afterward. Also  if you purchase the piggy bank for an amount higher than the $14.99 offer for 5-6 million coins  the only offer you'll receive after that is $34.99 for a little more than just 10 million coins. Other than that I enjoy the game  so long as all cheaters are promptly removed from playing any longer!,NEGATIVE,1,0.986718953,19-Feb-24
8 Ball Pool,Giving this game a 5-star rating  cause why not? This will definitely relieve your stress. I only have one issue about it. Everytime I open the game/app using my internet connection  it will load so long like it's almost a century until you can play a game. Or sometimes  if it's finally finish loading  it will hang and will go back to your home screen. So  in that case  you'll gonna have to open it again and wait and wait and wait for another round of waiting for it to open and start a game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997756302,3-Mar-24
8 Ball Pool,Currently downloaded on a new telecommunication device. The application will not open pass the boot screen. I've turned the device completely off. After waiting for some time the I turned the device back on. Power cord stayed connected at all times. Still no luck with the boot screen loading completely for the game to start it's play ground. Until fixed I would not suggest the game to any of my peers. Please help aid and assist. Thank you.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997282863,31-Mar-24
8 Ball Pool,This game is kinda fun aside from the 5 billion ads it constantly tries to shove in your face. It is also annoying that when you start up the game  it automatically has you preselected to play on an expensive game vs it starting at a low game and you choosing a more expensive game. I've accidentally clicked an expensive one before & leaving means you lose the coins so you are forced to play.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995260894,17-Mar-24
8 Ball Pool,This game for me was 5/5 but lately I'm getting lot of troubleshoot. If I join a game 1v1  the game starts and I end up on homescreen multiple times. Bcoz of which I don't get chance to play and eventually lose the money. I thought it was a glitch  I updated and I'm facing the same issue. I've lost almost half of my amount just coz of the directly switching on to the homescreen which automatically let the opponent win. I'm really pissed. I hope the issue gets solved.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999431431,22-Apr-24
8 Ball Pool,Too much ads  every now and then there ads  have you ever experienced like you lose in a match and then your in a bad mood then suddenly you can't proceed to next match cause you need to finish watching useless ads  that's quite annoying  and order to skip the ads you need to log out and log in again to the app  no other options cause when you click skip then you'll be forwarded to another Links,NEGATIVE,1,0.999719322,27-Apr-24
8 Ball Pool,I'm level 16  yet my opponent is level 125? Particularly in 9 pool. My bet was 500 coins  and my opponent 3-4 times higher than mine. Also  i have been exploring the app since i am a beginner. However  the app chose my opponent to be like  pro? I can't even take my turn since they shoot it like a pro? It is indeed challenging  but that's not fair. That's all  thank you. My first 10k match was lost because my first opponent at that level was 3 times higher than me.,NEGATIVE,1,0.983523548,2-Mar-24
8 Ball Pool,REGARDING ADS! PLAYERS STOP COMPLAINING! Play other games and you're required to watch 30-45 seconds of an ad  by the time you wait for all the X's and ã. All you do here is touch an  x   which does need to be larger ( XX ) The game needs to STOP ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO LEAVE THE GAME.. that is so very RUDE & UNSPORTS- MANLIKE CONDUCT! Plus that pop-up allows you to CHEAT!! I've played billiards for 60+ years.. this game is as close to the real thing as you're going to get!! ð¢ð â¤ï¸ ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.994162738,13-Apr-24
8 Ball Pool,This game has jumped the shark. It's so full of bot players and clear algorithm losses/scratches its just not fun anymore. If you don't pay for the pool pass it's so obvious it makes you lose/win at times. I just call it immediately. For that reason I'll never pay for the pass. Also deleted a best friend from my saved friends. I'm still on his. But I add him after every time we play. Next day his profile disappears & I can't even search for him w/ID#. I guess we played each other too much.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999573767,15-Feb-24
8 Ball Pool,It's simply unfair ...to go up against an opponent that's not only hundred levels above your own but have supercharged cues that are able to break the law of physics...oh and if that doesn't make you mad let's not forget the a.i. engine that will run the table with flawless accuracy to keep wins down to a minimum....I may win 1 out of 5 matches if i don't just quit all together,POSITIVE,0,0.994125485,24-Apr-24
8 Ball Pool,Excellent simulation of authentic pool play. I am continually amazed at how much of a  real  feel game play that this has. I've practiced spin and cue ball control. This is an edge at game control over my opponents. Loads of upgrades and games to play along the way. Find  win  or buy  cue  upgrades for fine-tuning game play. I guess that means I love MINICLIP pool. BUT: the collection of cues and how they are sorted NEEDS a fix. Very hard to find cues. Add a search option? Most recent first?,POSITIVE,0,0.980891764,20-Mar-24
8 Ball Pool,Gameplay itself is fine  but the game is riddled with the most disgusting monetization scheme possible. $8 weekly VIP subscription (includes exclusive tables)  separate Pool Pass subscription  specific cues that have to be bought   mini games  and literal loot boxes that cost $1-5 each just for a chance at a small reward. These transactions are advertised CONSTANTLY  all over the app  and there's even more then what I've listed.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998565137,20-Feb-24
8 Ball Pool,Came back after few years. More scummy and scammy than ever. Grinded up to around 17M in 9 ball pool  now i have around 50k left by always playing for the same amount of coins. Thanks to their algorithms. Also how they make sure to give you so many ways to  accidentally  misclick and end up losing coins or even real cash. This is the most anti-customer game ever  and an also  covertly and indirectly pay to win.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997564912,25-Apr-24
8 Ball Pool,I admit that this app is good  but one thing I hate is the ads  after a game an ad then popped up  it's so annoying edit... it keeps getting worse not just the ads but also when I'm playing  when it's my turn and close to winning  it's either there will be a problem on my aim wheel or the cue ball will shoot on the other side or just roll next to the ball i hit even though it's it's impossible for that to happen :((,NEGATIVE,1,0.998347282,14-Mar-24
8 Ball Pool,Love this game however  You get so far and then start encountering things that kill the buzz. Either the players cheat or the game does. There's a glitch. Club winnings and Weekly winnings stopped being counted for some players. Causes demotion to the previous league which sucks. Haven't changed country's or cheated so I don't know? Did I do something? Is it a bug? Fix it? No clear time frame for when your winnings go back to normal and no warning before it happens.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998562396,8-Apr-24
8 Ball Pool,I honestly love the game  the game play  the cues are all great ways of keeping you playing. But every second opponent I play is an absolute cheat  making impossible shots. They very obviously are using a cheto app of some kind and it's extremely demoralizing knowing that you're playing against someone who always is going to win no matter what. I went from winning 2 out 3 to losing 9 out 10 and I actually can't to anything about it  except report the cheating but how is this still allowed???,NEGATIVE,1,0.994302154,8-Apr-24
Going Balls,Probably the best of the  rolling ball  games out there. I'm currently on level 275. My only issue is the REPETITIVENESS! The courses repeat roughly every 50 levels  so you are just stuck doing the same thing over and over. I'd like to see more variety in the courses to keep it fresh. Courses could have varying levels of gravity  terrain types  etc. I also think it would be neat if the different balls had different stats  such as speed  mass  bounce  ground and air maneuverability  etc.,NEGATIVE,1,0.853668988,28-Mar-24
Going Balls,This game is really good. I gave 4 stars because of the advertisements present in this game. Moreover  l loved the quality  animation in this game. And the best part is  it is not that easy to win in the hard levels. That is the major thing which attracted me to this game. I really recommend this game to play. NOTE : if you want to play this game with no ads  just turn off your wifi  and no annoying ads will disturb you. Hope this is helpful. Enjoy!,POSITIVE,0,0.999690175,24-Apr-24
Going Balls,TOO LAGGY for a small app. My net is very fast/stable  and even if it isnt  it shouldnt impact the game performance. TOO MANY ads  literally. Every deaths and every levels theres an ad. It paused/stopped my game for no reason only for it to tell me to continue. MANY maps are VOMIT INDUCING  literally DISGUSTING. I canNOT stand those maps. Overall  HIGHLY ADVICED to not download. I only pushed myself to do this because I need to get rewards from another game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99945122,23-Apr-24
Going Balls,It's really fun. Not too many adds  a perfect game to pass the time  and an amazing way to have fun when there's not much to do. However  I rated it four stars because the adds don't work at all. I don't know if it is my phone or the game  but I'm definitely connected to the internet and it's frustrating when I want to continue a challenge level or get extra coins but I can't  because the adds don't load. All in all  it is still an amazing game and I definitely recommend it.,POSITIVE,0,0.99965167,25-Mar-24
Going Balls,So many ads. It has ads at the end of every level  every time you die  & even while you're in a level. Not to mention how incredibly laggy it is. Everything in the game is behind either a pay wall or by watching ads. Incredibly annoying  do not recommend.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999630213,4-Apr-24
Going Balls,The game was boring but after level 50 the levels are super fun and challenging. You can just turn on airplane mode do remove the ads and it becomes an addicting fun game that I keep coming back to. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the pig at the end of levels keeps rizzing up my friends constantly.,POSITIVE,0,0.988987863,2-Mar-24
Going Balls,I really love it cause there are a lot of challenges   portal runs   races   banana frenzy and tournaments. I love collecting tickets and I have completed 539 tickets. Just turn off the internet if there are a lot of ads cause this game is offline. But play this game without stress .Okay so whatever I am writing from here it is an edit. I was just asking pls add some other challenges in bcoz they are just like levels and not any other thing. Wishing you a great journey ðð»,POSITIVE,0,0.982246041,4-Mar-24
Going Balls,This game is fun and well made. You never have to worry about boring repeating levels because each level of this game has a new design to explore. Most levels being intricate and even aploud worthy. The only reason I don't give five stars is because the controls with steering the ball can be a bit difficult.,POSITIVE,0,0.998135686,9-Mar-24
Going Balls,This game is useless and will only take up space on my phone. I decided to give the game a try but then I beat the first level and I'm like   okay this game seems fine  but then  it popped up with an ad and I was well most games do that so  okay. But then I tried to play the second level and guess what? Can you guess? AN AD POPPED UP RIGHT AS I GOT OUT OF THE LAST ONE. I WAITED THERE FOR 8 MINUTES JUST FOR THE GAME TO NOT ALLOW ME TO CLOSE THE AD. THIS GAME SUCKS.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998198807,18-Feb-24
Going Balls,Meh  Look for free  its a pretty okay game. I gotmit for my 4 year old. Paid for the ad free (obviously my 4 yea old doesn't understand the ads) once the levels got to hard I reset it to the beguiling. Seems to have reset the ads  even though I already paid  but now there is no way to either reset that  or pay again for ad free.,NEGATIVE,1,0.989336967,24-Feb-24
Going Balls,Every time you proceed to a new level  there is an ad. I understand this is how games make revenue. However  it also makes the game extremely annoying  especially given how short the levels are. If they were to decrease the number of ads  I could see this being a fun game  but as it stands  it's basically an ad simulator.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997461319,19-Feb-24
Going Balls,The ads on this game make it exceedingly frustrating to play. The 'x' to close them are like so many others and the impact zone to close the ad is so small you're almost forced to visit the sponsor. Please be clear that I understand how  free to play  games work. (Ad revenue makes it free) This game has entirely too many. So to end on a positive the game is fun. I would love to play this one alot.,POSITIVE,0,0.878421545,29-Mar-24
Going Balls,Terrible on Android . It performs so poorly after level 20 that even the ads glitch out. Seemingly the last update made it worse. Imagine so many errors that you can't even get paid from the overabundance of ads there are. It's such a shame too  since this game is amazing on my iPhone and iPad. And yes my current android device has full compatibility,NEGATIVE,1,0.999786556,14-Feb-24
Going Balls,This game sucks. It's the same 10 levels over and over. I got to level 250 hoping they would change at some point  but they don't. I paid to get rid of ads so that hasn't been an issue. Just boring and not challenging. The racing and goal ball are the best things.,NEGATIVE,1,0.542682707,1-Mar-24
Going Balls,I love this game a lot it is full of challenges and I just love it but if you fail any of the level you will loose a ball or just have to watch an ad which is freakin 30 sec but it's fun to play but be beware of the challenges given by the game for every level there would be new challenges so you have to try playing itâ¤ï¸â¤ï¸ð©·â¤ï¸,POSITIVE,0,0.988313138,28-Feb-24
Going Balls,I saw an ad for this game and it looked pretty fun. It's bad. 1 It's an offline game(according to the ad it was online). 2 The gameplay's boring. 3 Ads(sometimes l got ads in the middle of the level). One of the worst games l ever played.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999752581,20-Apr-24
Going Balls,I LOVE THIS GAME. It is entertaining and keeps your attention for a while. The levels are sometimes hard but fun. It's great to play as a no Wi-Fi game on flights. I also really like the hard levels to the side as sometimes as an extra challenge.,POSITIVE,0,0.999744117,17-Mar-24
Going Balls,Tracks don't end according to how you set out. Some dynamic play is OK but there needs to be a certain amount of reliability also. When you make agreements with money paying apps or whatever  be sure to stick to that and instead of making it seem harder with endless play,NEGATIVE,1,0.989055872,8-Feb-24

Going Balls,This game is realyyyyyyyyyyyyy funnnn so fun that i can play every day . But one problem until you get to level 63 or something it's like the same level over and over . But that does not stop me from playing but over all it is a really really really fun game i love everything about it i love all of the balls especially the one thats a puffer fish ð¡ . we play all the time that we are already on level 467 i want to reach up to level 1000.i â¤ï¸ this game so much there should be a poster .,POSITIVE,0,0.999352396,25-Mar-24
Going Balls,Game lures you into a false sense of security by giving you an ad every 4 or 5 levels at the start. You get invested. They then hit you with ads every level  every death and occasionally mid level mid roll. It got to the point of bogging down my phone. It's fun and challenging at first  but quickly becomes tedious. Tedious isn't the fun kind of challenging. Made it to around level 75 before deciding to call it quits.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99941206,20-Nov-23
Going Balls,It's a really great game  not like I've seen in other mobile games. Alot of people were complaining about the but you can just turn on airplane mode. Some levels are kinda impossible to beat though. After about level 100ish I noticed that all the levels were just reused  and that does make it repetitive sometimes. One thing that I really like are the tournaments and races (even though your racing against bots) and the bonus levels and minigames that are in between some of the levels.,NEGATIVE,1,0.992370248,18-Jan-24
Going Balls,I played it 5 minutes. 4 minutes of it where watching advertising and 44 seconds to wait for the level to load. Means 2 level each 8 seconds and I waisted 5 minutes. Not fun at all!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999539852,25-Apr-24
Going Balls,The worse! The ABSOLUTE WORSE GAME EVER! You will barely get to play. There is/are more ads than there is gameplay. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME  DO NOT INSTALL. keep searching in the app store. Find a similar game that values gameplay over making money.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999408364,28-Apr-24

Going Balls,One star is too good for this garbage  I have a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and this app will crash for no freaking reason  I'll be in the middle of a level and... Well you get the idea. For a very simple game it shouldnt crash on an I phone 2g (the first smartphone  before android). I will avoid games by this developer like the plague.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999531984,13-Apr-24
Going Balls,Absolutely terrible for ads. This is by far the worst game of ever play for ads in your face. They even have ads with a fake exit cross button to make you think you can exit it and then it takes you to the Play store... I wouldn't recommend this app to my worst enemy,NEGATIVE,1,0.999803364,9-Apr-24
Going Balls,Horrible. Every time You complete a level THEY SHOW YOU ADS ! Guys who are seeing this review and are about to download it DO NOT. trust me you will hate this game . creators of this game bad job on making this game I hate this game so much that I'm deleting this game . please consider a new game the next time you make one.

Thank you and guys don't download it thx.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99976939,26-Feb-24
Going Balls,It's fun in the beginning  but then the levels get way too hard after level 50. Some angles of the camera does not help either  it'll be hard to see where I'm going and can't control the ball. I mostly had to resort to watching the ads to skip many jumps  but the ads can get annoying especially when they pop up in the middle of the game and you end up having to restart at the checkpoints,NEGATIVE,1,0.998744369,3-Feb-24
Going Balls,It's fun but there are SO! MANY! ADS! I mean  you can turn your wifi off and play but that shouldn't be what I NEED to do so that I can actually play the game. And you might be thinking  well you don't NEED to turn wifi to play. There might be a few ads but you can still play.  Well  your right. Sometimes. Sometimes you get ads you can skip after 5 seconds  sometimes you get ads where you have to wait 30 seconds  and sometimes you gets ads where you have to fully close the app cuz no  x  appears,POSITIVE,0,0.91404283,12-Dec-23
Going Balls,This app is nothing but a cash cow. Each levels lasts less than 10 seconds  and they show you an ad after EVERY SINGLE LEVEL you pass. The ads have sound and multiple screens before you can actually close them. There are also some ads that automatically install an app if you tap while trying to close it. On top of that  the game itself is trash. You can tell there was no interest in making a game that people like. It is only an app to squeeze out as much money as possible. Trash trash trash.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999663115,11-Jan-24

Going Balls,I have had a great experience up until level 151  the ball does not 'roll' properly and glitches when I roll the ball  I can't complete this level until it stops glitching and it's been glitching for 2 months. I refuse to delete it since I paid for no ads. This game is offline and when it gets to the higher levels  the levels are repeated.

Going Balls,To the developers- You have lost a full purchase of this game. There's a fine line between too many adverts and giving people a chance to like a game. I think I would have purchased  but the amount of adverts / pop ups / installs are UNBELIEVABLE! Just as you start to get into the game  another pop up! You've crossed that fine line and gone to the other side! A shame  but now uninstalled due to your greed of adverts (that I NEVER look at) and a lost sale because I always buy my games. Your loss!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999452412,4-Jan-24

Going Balls,The game isn't horrible however it can get very repetitive over time. As someone who is currently on level 971 I've realized overrated this app is. At the start it was a nice game with moderate to difficult however after level 105 ish it becomes very repetitive which is very annoying. The amount of ads is also horrible. After you die you get ads. Honestly wouldn't recommend the game but it can get pretty addicting at times which is why I rate it 3 stars.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997612,17-Dec-23
Going Balls,It's fun. But every single time I die I get an ad and you can't even escape them... it's very annyoing not to mention I went afk for a minute and when I came back I was dead. So you slowly move the ball. FIX THIS PLEASE,NEGATIVE,1,0.981654525,19-Feb-24
Going Balls,Too many ads too soon. Instant uninstall. Edit: I was served up an ad for this game on Instagram  I believe in second chances so I thought I'd give it another chance cause I like physics skill games. 54 seconds it took from install to full page ad. It's clear you are not listening to your reviewers. I would view far more ads  maybe even purchase something in game if you didn't make the experience so unbearable! Uninstalled...

Going Balls,I honestly love this game. The ads are extremely annoying  but all you have to do is turn on aeroplane mode and you won't see any. My only issue is that after around level 90 you just get repeats of the same levels from earlier. So your basically just playing the exact same levels over and over,NEGATIVE,1,0.992717385,6-Jan-24
Going Balls,This game always has an add and its so annoying I just want to play it in peace and also the name is so weird it is very fun no not get me wrong but the adds just ruin it and it is very very annoying every time I fall an add pops up and It makes me want to rage quit other than that it is amazing I recommend it but if you do not like adds then this game is not for you I may delete it because how many adds there are but when your in the car on an long trip there are no adds I recommend it is fun,NEGATIVE,1,0.988660812,9-Mar-24
Going Balls,It's fun but the ads pop up at random times sometimes and slows the game down for me  sometimes to where it closes down in the middle of a round,NEGATIVE,1,0.994458199,6-Mar-24
Going Balls,A good and amusing offline game but the only 1 issue that I'm at level 1985 and have almost 30M coins but there're no new levels and hurdles. And Since when I crossed almost 500 levels it's all the same  and I own every ball in this game  there's no update and no new balls to purchase by coins anymore. I have no use of these 30M coins anymore. At the end  there are no goals to achieve in this game for me anymore. *I'm expecting the creator to add new levels  updates  side quests  Balls Etc.*,NEGATIVE,1,0.997054219,29-Jan-24
Going Balls,I just re downloaded this game after not playing it for a long time  and I like that there are new levels  but I really miss the old levels from when I used to play.

Hunter Assassin,So many people install a mobile game with the expectation of using it like a PC or console game. This game is exactly what you see in the ads. The gameplay is repetitive  yes  but every 10 levels or so  a new element is added that forces you to change how you play it. The difficulty is upped  and it's a great to kill time with. For those who complain about all the ads  if you turn on airplane mode everytime before you start the app  you'll never have to watch a single ad.,POSITIVE,0,0.989124656,26-Mar-24
Hunter Assassin,It's by far my favourite game. I'm at level 881 now  can there be more challenges added in? The levels are repetitive and thus appears less challenging.

Indian Bikes Driving 3D,It is a fantastic game. In this game  there is so many bikes  cars  animals trucks  as well as train ððð .

Indian Bikes Driving 3D,Indian bikes 3d it is a best game I have seen a beautiful city with less population but the city is looking like a abanded city . The reason is the NPC s are very less but there are many mods many cheat codes many cars and many bikes but there is only numbers that we can't remember it's graphics is so high quality but the only problem is that there is no missions that make the beautify of the game low but they are updating every month as I hope they will include these things .,POSITIVE,0,0.977847099,23-Apr-24

Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,The experience of this game was so good  the graphics are like a dangerous ride. If I talk about driving then it is much better than any other car driving game. Car destruction  drifting  stunts and tasks are awesome. Sometimes I feel like I'm actually driving a race car. But the addition creates too much interference between the game and comes within seconds. That's just too tired. And everything is fine in this game.. ð¯,POSITIVE,0,0.872829854,5-Mar-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,I have been playing on and off for a couple of years now. It is a fun game  but there continues to be an issue when they do updates. I have collected nearly 200 cars  at one point having about 1/3 fully upgraded. I say at this because as they have updated the game  the car updates tend to go backwards. Without having made a list  I about 60+ cars have been downgraded  and many back to 0 updates. This is especially an issue since it takes a lot of coins and cards to upgrade. Save your money.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994429648,1-Mar-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,Good day. Just a revamp of my review while still retaining 5 stars  overall the game is great  music  visuals  features  mechanisms  all good. My only complaint was ads. No  not the  manual  ads where you manually or intentionally want to watch an ad for a reward  but the forced ads instead. After going through buttons to buttons  an ad. Sometimes after a race  an ad. I can't even predict it. Its random. Sometimes its frequent then...just mitigate the ads  alright. The game is good otherwise.,POSITIVE,0,0.996448636,2-Mar-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,This app deserves a five star no cap.But there is one problem I have the world series my only way of getting tokens keep telling error failed to connect to server and it is really frustrating please I beg of me fix this little problem ð.

Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,I mean  the game I love it  it is a really nice game. I love racing games and this is one of my favorites  the reason why I rate this 3 star I because of pay to win  now that all the cars are tokens  they are wayyy to overpriced  a class B car is 2000 tokens Like what?!?! Next is the ads  there are always ads that pop up  I still love the game  its not that I hate it  it just needs improvement. My recommendation is lower down the car prices or make all cars credit cars and lessen ads.,POSITIVE,0,0.984126747,20-Apr-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,Unfortunately the game has a lot of problems including the upgrades of the car  I don't know who had the idea of making 2 new currencies  the costumes part is ok the gameplay is still 10 out of 10. This is the 3rd time I've reinstalled the game and each time had to start from 0 cuz my account had been deleted or lost. In all  I do not recommend  I'm going to try to play the 9th gane and see how it goes,NEGATIVE,1,0.998090327,4-Apr-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,you can still play this game offline but in order to fully enjoy it you need to be connected to the Internet most of the time. And lately  besides the intrusive adverts the currencies are now sort of adjusted in terms of what you can actually buy and it is not to the player's advantage. Unless you're willing to sell an organ or 2 don't expect to rank up by just playing the game,NEGATIVE,1,0.997838438,23-Apr-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,I used yo play the game a long time ago and then I downloaded it again now. It used to be very fun but now the game is nearly pay to play becuase trying to advance to other seasons in career mode without paying is nearly IMPOSSIBLE and the game used to have cars available to buy using fusion coins but know most of them are very very hard to get. Plus sometimes when I watch adds to get something I never get the item and it's really annoying. Please fix the bug :(,NEGATIVE,1,0.998934686,21-Mar-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,Man where do I even begin. Used to play this game with a friend in 2015 and it was an absolute blast. Most cars weren't locked behind a paywall  the classes were actually evenly distributed  cars for tokens would regularly go on sale for credits  giving f2p players a chance to get them  upgrades were obtainable without watching 50 ads  credits actually did something. I could go on and on. Now the game is just unrecognizable. It's really a shame what Gameloft has done to Asphalt 8.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999511719,6-Mar-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,If nothing else this game has the best sound track of any racing game so far. This game has tried to keep up with supposed modern trends instead making the single player experience feel bloated and cumbersome ads don't always deliver on the rewards and can be annoying that being said the racing is still loads of fun the tracks provide unique opportunity's the crashes feel impactful. the multiplayer was ok but also feels limited although rewards are decent.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997262478,24-Apr-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,This is a very good game. Its graphics and music are very good. I have been playing this game for 6.7 years. There is a problem in this confusion. It used to be hard to get tokens but now you can get them in Worldclass Season and Gauntlet. Today the game got an error and 1200+ tokens disappeared. It happened once before. Please fix this issue.

Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,After playing Alsphat 8 Airborne for 10 years It's Not that good anymore. To many changes every update  you can't even set a goal to achieve something for the next 2 updates since the game changes every update eg: prices and currencies of cars and upgrades  cars come in an out each update an to many car buffs. To many bugs and the game cheats me with rewards in game and rewards form watching videos. Also multiplayer is buggy and glitching. Cars crash to easily  slight touch wreck. So Bad 4/10.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999709547,5-Mar-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,It meets all my expectations regarding a car game   the controls are really good   the game modes are really smooth and specially the cars are extremely hot. The only reason I ain't giving it a 5 star review is because getting cars of higher tier needs a lot of sweat   and upon that the cost of upgrading the game constantly pops ads   else its the perfect car game,NEGATIVE,1,0.527526498,19-Apr-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,I am giving this game a two star rating because the creators of the game have made it basically impossible to get cars in the game without having to spend money ð°ð° or doing stupid events for tokens. I remember playing this game like 2 years ago and it was about half the cars were buyable with credits and now they all basically cost tokens so I want this to change so that I can buy at least 3-4 cars in each class with credits. If changed than I will change my rating.ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.997287393,10-Apr-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,What good are asphalt credits now? Now I need to buy vouchers? Really? This game has the most disturbing and annoying intrusive ad in the world! All the hard work to buy upgrades and after achieving  all was taken away on 28th Jan 2023  all cars and bikes owned have lost all it's upgrades  boosters and all else GONE..! Now it's 31st of March  upgrades still not returned. I had to start again with no help. The devs don't even deserve a speck of stardust!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999728262,27-Apr-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,Fantastic game  love it since I was a kid to this day. But now it's just pay to win  no real progression. Career doesn't even work correctly since some of the cars required for it were removed  making it obsolete. In terms of game play alone I still love it but it's not friendly to new players. You can't even play multi-player with friends without being right next to them.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997638941,27-Apr-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,I had installed this game around 6 to 5 years ago. I had loved the game back then There were more cars like the Supra And the upgrades were based on credits. Now upgrades takes mostly fusion coins which are somehow hard to get a lot I really want to upgrade cars with credits as they are a t lot easier to get the the fusion coins,NEGATIVE,1,0.974479377,29-Apr-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,This game used to be the best game ever. But the fact they are making it impossible to finish the game without paying just for one car. It's annoying and the fact that you greedy game developers make it impossible to grind for tokens makes it even worse. And if players can't grind for tokens then why not just remove it? There's too much ads and the  premium pass  is hot garbage. plus the game changes constantly and people like me who used to play it a lot can't keep up with the updates.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999582231,19-Apr-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,Disappointed. Don't get me wrong I've loved this game for years  but the more updates the game has the harder it is to collect cars. Now you've substituted ways of purchase; before you save up your fusion coins and credits and now there's tokens  vouchers and gauntlet badges that you have to purchase? I'm going back to playing NFS most wanted on my PS2 ð«¡,NEGATIVE,1,0.996174455,6-Mar-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,i love this game so much.. but i hate to say there's too many ads. when i click on something i just hope there's no ads to spend my time with. isn't it ridiculous when the race took only about 1.30 mins but you have to watch 30sec ads before and after that? it took 2/3 time with ads? and it's not only about time  but also about data that i spend on ads. it spend more than Instagram. about 500mb/day for ads is sick.. it say to do 1st purchase to remove ads and i did  but the ads is still there. ?,NEGATIVE,1,0.998553574,14-Apr-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,Ignoring the fact I lost all my data and cars I decided to try and give this game a try one more time. I genuinely don't think this game can fall any further. The only way you can get credits that isn't grinding races for eons is to watch ads. You can't even upgrade anymore as everything is based off of the old tuning system  and you either have to buy everything with real life money or completely grind at for eons. I'd rather see WW3 happen than have to deal with this. Fix your game,NEGATIVE,1,0.999309063,12-Mar-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,I give a one. Too many ads and also you can't purchase new car after season 1 with the coins you win. I see this a a salemans pitch trying to rip every penny out of my pocket. This is too much  can restore it back to older verzion where you can our purchase cars with the coins you won in the race?,NEGATIVE,1,0.999302149,26-Apr-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,Great game but bombarded with annoying apps each and every second  can't seem to buy vehicles using fusion coins despite having a few thousand of them  I watch videos to get more credits but denied by you devs  great just great and to add salt to injury they also removed the dice rolls  just nothing but disappointing  keep it up,NEGATIVE,1,0.998366892,28-Apr-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,Revert the orginal system of buying cars/bikes using credits or fusion coins.. this new money centric version of asphalt 8 sucks..!! Earlier atleast it seemed possible to buy S-Class cars but now it's nearly impossible to buy even B-Class cars if you don't want to spend thousands of money on buying tokens,NEGATIVE,1,0.999658465,27-Apr-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,The game is cool. This advice is for people who are having the problem of the stopping of the download of the actual game that  make sure you have enough internet supply  as the actual game occupies about 3 gb of data. AVOID playing the mini game  that is the main cause for the stopping of the download. My phone is very slow and often hangs  but still the game quality is excellent  so it may be an internet issue.

Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,Advertfest. Dozens of them  it's not possible to spend more than 2 minutes without an advert.

It's a nice game  and they have to get paid somehow  but when you spend more time watching ads than actually playing  it's time to find another game,NEGATIVE,1,0.996254325,19-Mar-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,I played this game when it came out and then forgot about it for ages. I came back about a year ago after playing A9. This game has so many positives compared to A9. It's laughable. No fuel is needed. The multi-player is actually enjoyable. The racing passes are so insane for the price(in a good way). The game is super smooth  and the gameplay is exhilarating. I must admit there is a slight pay to win barrier  but it's light-years away from the pay to win gap in A9. Customization lacking a bit,POSITIVE,0,0.996013641,28-Feb-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,I can no longer rate this game 5 stars. Over the years it has become absurdly pay-to-win. Festivals used to be good  as you were able to get A and S class cars for free by reaching the end. This is not the case now. Multiplayer mode is filled with pay-to-win players who dominate due to their maxed Jesko Absoluts. The final straw was when they made literally all cars cost tokens (currency nearly impossible to obtain without paying irl). I wish the developers would bring back the old game :(,NEGATIVE,1,0.995989859,18-Mar-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,This is one of my best mobile racing games but it's become more expensive lately. Cars can hardly be accessed by coins anymore which makesme wonder why we have the coins as rewards in the first place. I think you guys should really look into it. As much as you want to makemoney for the game you should allow the players to enjoy the game without weighing their pockets.,POSITIVE,0,0.99765563,15-Apr-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,Gameplay is fun. But unless your spending a good amount of money your hitting a pay wall pretty fast. Even for the offline career mode. Once you get to the second class of cars you can not upgrade any new cars unless you use in game currency that you have to Grind for. There are 5 in game currencies. The easiest one to get requires watching a 30sec add after every race otherwise you get almost nothing. Even if you watch the adds it's a stupid grind for little progression starting early.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99455148,16-Apr-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,Had a good time back in 2015  but now they completely ruined the game.

A beautiful and amazing game ruined by its own greedy devs,NEGATIVE,1,0.999748886,23-Apr-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,Yes that's what the others said the game has so many ads way to many  even when your starting a race it does have ads and also even when your done with your race there's ads to.

Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,The game is excellent. With high quality graphics but I gave only 2 star rating for this game as because after every update a lot of cars are not available to buy. In the starting of game there were 300+ cars were available to buy but now there are just 176. The first image of this game also depicts that in the game there are 300+ high performance cars but they not.,POSITIVE,0,0.929342091,14-Mar-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,It's gotten disappointing... As far as I've experinced this game. You may delete the game to save some space and re-download it eventually you'll find your account is Still there. The current problem is There's no othe car you can Get in other classes except fo class D. Reason being all the cars are now bought using TOKENS and those you'll not find lying around... even car upgrades' There's no way you can enjoy this game at low speed. Until then GAMELOFT...

Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,Excellent game with smooth graphics and amazing performance. Would've been even better if you could actually cross out the ads without missing and ending up in the play store (lost a lot of precious boosts as a result).

Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,This game used to be fun years ago. Pricing is a bit high.

Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,The game is very exciting and interesting   it has great graphics  lots of cars but in this game I did not like this situation that first Even if you take 2.3 GB data  you will still have to download maps to go into the game and if you want to get something good  you will have to watch ads. I did not like all this  but the game is fine.,POSITIVE,0,0.99730742,11-Apr-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,The game is so fun. You can race people online  and even customize your cars. The game is like a way to learn how to drive and manage money$. So far I have earned $30.000000. the game helps anyone learn even though there is no math â. The game has evolved my focusing on things  like ramps and turbulence. The game has to be the best racing game of all time besides  Grand Theft Auto 5. My siblings love the game sooo much. We can't ever stop playing it. I love this game so much.

Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,It's gotten boring. there hasn't been a new track or career level in years.

For example I came back after some months and now I can't find nissan nismo.. i came back cause I wanted to buy that but it's not buyable anymore.. it's just sad. Another thing is that all the maps are kind of like fantasy type with ramps and stuff everywhere.. it would be really good if there was a map like some circuit based on irl where in game physics would be much more good,NEGATIVE,1,0.998410225,25-Mar-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,I love this game  i am already it for 2 years but theres a very bad thinkg about this game   which is that you can play multiplayer woth random players but not with friends  however there is a option to ay on local wifi bit it doesn't help this is serious issue on game  (providing the game mode but you can't use it is annyoing) i hope that this issue will be fixed soon,NEGATIVE,1,0.998481095,21-Apr-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,Car rate is very expensive. And during in game adds so bad.I have been playing this game for the last 17 years but I have not been able to buy a car yet due to the high price .

Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,I've been playing for years now & have over $300 invested in this account alone. Handling performance has become far less accurate in the passing yrs and currencies has become increasingly difficult to acquire this deeply saddens me I play Asphalt 8&9 religiously my faith in these games is fading B rank and up vehicles have unresponsive turning and braking leading to far to many wrecks and as far as the Dodge motorbike goes I hate it it's impossible to control Please fix these things=5 stars ð¯%,NEGATIVE,1,0.99961406,26-Apr-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,Absolutely a pay to win game. This game is the most greedy game i have ever played. You have to watch an ad before every race. And if you are just sitting around i guaranty you that you will get an ad within 5 minutes. Apart from this  this game has 3 basic currency credit  fashion coin and tokens  basically you can get credit and fashion coin if you play but you can't get tokens without giving them your delicious money. And new update made a change that you can't buy a single car without it.ð©,POSITIVE,0,0.983128071,2-Mar-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,Actual garbage. Used to be good before it was flooded with ads and upgrade prices skyrocketed. They flooded it with cars that are mechanically identical. Buying some cars is cheap but upgrading requires actual money. There is no effective way to grind the coins. Ads play every couple minutes and after most races. Some are skipable others aren't. It's like they want to drive away free users or squeeze a ton of money out of them. Buy a high level car with money? Gotta spend to upgrade it too. 0/5,NEGATIVE,1,0.99944967,17-Feb-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,First of all TOO MANY ADS!! Like literally every time I click something i had to watch an ad ... Secondly  I can't buy any car with credits unless you had tokens and how you get tokens? of course by buying them with real money... This is ridiculous ..the game used to be alot of fun years ago ..but now I can't even buy a car unless i buy it with money ! What the benefit of giving me credits in game if i cannot use them?,NEGATIVE,1,0.999275744,12-Mar-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,Good game but the cars are extremely hard once you get to the Bugatti chiron or pininfarina Battista. Graphics are ok ish could be better. Drift control is not the best but asphalt 9 has taken it to the next level. So basically if you want retro get asphalt 8 or if you want a good game get asphalt 9. Also asphalt 9 on the Nintendo switch is amazing as well the cars are equally hard to unlock but even when u do it's very rewarding so overall very good game 5 stars ð¤©,POSITIVE,0,0.998787344,28-Mar-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,i am loving the game...still having a issues with the fact that it has gotten a lot more complicated to get the blue tokens...it needs to have more tasks or challenges geared towards obtaining those blue tokens ???still having issues with getting the other tokens as well...that suck...new stuff still difficult to get...needs to have that fixed,NEGATIVE,1,0.784940958,29-Feb-24
Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,This game has a lot of problems 1. It's show's lots of adds that you'll be forced to watch it always & each add you've to cross several times. That's so annoying. 2. This game buffering a lot For that you can't claim dice properly  can't sell extra item's or convert properly can't buy car properly 3. They will provide you lot of gifts from event join like booster nitro starting  extra tank  car kit etc but it won't gather to your inventory.

Asphalt 8 - Car Racing Game,This game has improved after many complex changes and things added in the game (initially not liked by many).

Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic,So far it's been pretty fun to play. It hasn't cost anything yet  and I seem to be racking up coins quickly. We'll see how far that goes. I wish that status bar was at the bottom though instead of the top. It tends to block the view ahead making the time you have to make split second choices a bit limited  but not impossible.

Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic,It has a nice world where the road turns  rises  and falls. The instrument cluster seems to be malfunctioning though  so is the gear box. It sounds like it's always maxed on the first gear and it's annoying. Maybe I missed something  there seems to be no manual mode and the tutorials didn't say anything with regards to shifting. Also  the first and selected bike is a scooter  but on the road you'll be riding some sort of cruiser. If I missed something  let me know.

Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic,Played for 1 day. Made it through the first 13 stages. The second motorcycle was maxed out on all options available. The game would not let me advance to the next level becsuse I would lose. I don't have enough game cash for the next motorcycle and refuse to spend the real money to get it. I realize it is how they make their money. I just refuse to pay AND watch multiple ads for other games on every level. Decide to make your money through ads or purchases. I won't do both.

Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic,I was asked for more details on my 3â­ review. Ok  I've lowered to 2â­. Why? Upgrades! They are all down grades. Steering faster is worse. Topspeed got lower for some reason. Going from 20 nitro to 100 nitro makes ZERO difference  not longer or faster... Pointless. Every level is identical. Stay in the center and don't move. It's a decent concept but poorly executed. I understand it's just a quick and dirty money grab but at least have some pride in your work.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998912334,18-Oct-23
Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic,Game is ok but the ads are too much. I have to click the close button 3 times just to close a single add.

Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic,It's a pretty good game just not the best game that follows this formula.

Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic,When I started downloading a game in this app  it listed the apps I should delete in order to download it  and I deleted those apps so that it would start and it did. After a while it finished and I checked I ani it wrote  This app cannot be installed see common ways to fix the problem  send your feedback  And I was shocked.... All I have to say is fix the problem please...... The caution should appear before the download and not after the download  so we don't waste our data.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997374177,16-Jan-23
Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic,Game was ausome  but it has limited game level its maximum levels are 60   I think it has one technical foult there is no need to move bike handle while u are get turn  its atomatically get turn . If you set bike at middle of street line it can be atomatically get complete the levelsð I HOPE developers can add more levels and do some corrections in control settings,NEGATIVE,1,0.894652009,4-Apr-21
Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic,Superb game  BUT . I know it needs ridiculous amounts of adverts to pay for itself but it take a stupid amount of time to choose options and buy stuff then it's a 30 second advert before you play ! There is more time spent on the menu than there is actual game play,NEGATIVE,1,0.999160051,22-Feb-23
Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic,Game looked great and played well when I first downloaded it. A few days later  though  the screen started blacking out EVERY time I raced. Impossible to play now  so I uninstalled. I'm thankful that I never paid for anything. Your mileage may vary. (Ha! Get it?!),POSITIVE,0,0.929220438,11-Mar-19
Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic,Very poor experience. I downloaded this game with lots of hope but the app doesn't allow you to play properly because it is full of adds. Like  2 adds every 5 minutes! In the middle of the game!! And later  the game hangs down. Waste of data to be honest.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999763072,25-Jan-22
Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic,Google Team - Please check the kind of ads this developer is using. There is no option to close the ad unless it's 20 seconds. There is no option to report the ad euther. Pressing back button can't stop the ad. The only way to stop the ad is to wait for 20 to 30 seconds and then fing the tiny X whisb is hard to click due to corner curve of the screen,NEGATIVE,1,0.998782814,18-Aug-22
Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic,It was pretty fun but won't let you repeat levels. When the kids ask to play being able to replay a past level is convenient. I will be uninstalling but I think other people may still enjoy playing it. Just not what I was looking for.,NEGATIVE,1,0.992610514,19-Mar-19
Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic,Wasn't sure what to think  the game seemed ok with tilt as controls  but as others said. Ads  the bane to a good game.

Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic,Another ad server pretending to be a game. Constant  obnoxious ads  interrupted by mediocre gameplay. At every step and before and after every race  a 30 second unskippable ad  with another 10 second  click here  page. Unplayable.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99969542,19-Mar-22
Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic,Ok game but some how I purchased something for 9.99 a week. Well needless to say I cancelled that right away . It could be a fun game if you didn't have to buy something all the time it asks you if you want to buy something after every race and every time you go to play the game well I deleted it. I gave it 2 stars I think it was a gift along with 10.00$ I gave them.,NEGATIVE,1,0.922800064,14-Jul-20
Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic,This app is great! I love the controls and everything! But  The reason I gabe this app 4 stars is because  I feel like this game is incomplete  it needs a free drive mode so not only ypu could time yourself  but  if you get bored of doing times  you could go and free drive and just relax and cruise down the animated road! When this game finally has what im asking for then i will play this game again. And give this app 5 stars. Keep going strong I see a good future in this app!,POSITIVE,0,0.992020667,22-Dec-20

Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic,This game is quite interesting and enjoyable to play coz there's a lot of levels here that u need to unlock and its good and challenging but one thing I've noticed in this game is maybe u added some beautiful backgrounds there not the same background u put in it coz Its kind a boring but overall  I love this game and I feel that I really drive a Motorcycle. ðð..Thanks.,POSITIVE,0,0.999183238,14-Nov-20
Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic,I don't like the way the game transaction to the curve its so unrealistic and while on the turn it doesn't turn the way it should.

Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic,Best of the first person traffic riding games I've found but. Why have all the different looking bikes when the actual ingame bike doesn't even look like them? What is the point of the bike customization when you don't even see that bike when riding? Other riding games have different looking bikes in the first person view so this should too. Someone's been lazy... ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.997800291,5-Jan-19
Moto Rider GO: Highway Traffic,Too easy  gameplay is boring. It's okay at best for a time waster on the toilet. I beat every level without paying real money although it's very clear the game is designed to milk you of every cent ($40 per month  vip  subscription really??? $1.50 for a single meaningless extra life??). Fake multiplayer mode  you race against bots. Poor graphics  the  screenshots  here are fake. Annoying notification spam.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999720514,6-Nov-21

Running Pet: Dec Rooms,nice little game with cute aesthetic  pets are sweet looking and sounding  areas are adorable to build  compared to many running games it is hard work to raise funds by collecting coins  gems or tokens for different rooms or characters  racing feature is especially challenging as competing pets have some turbo mode they just whizz past on the track  it would be nice if there were even more exciting ways we could add previously released characters to our collection and let us change our avatars!,POSITIVE,0,0.990251064,15-Dec-23

Running Pet: Dec Rooms,It's a lot like Tom's Gold Run. It's interesting but it's not very smooth gameplay. It's not lagging necessarily but it's not maneuver friendly. You move right or left or slide but it doesn't always move your character and you end up running into things or dying a lot. Ads are annoying but expected with any game anymore.

Real Cricket GO,I have been playing this game since 2023 and loved the overall experience. However few things I have noticed that if added  it would be real life experience such as practice net  real bowling experience as per batsman weakness and unbiased runout decisions. I have noticed a lot that whenever I took runs during shot within 30 yards circle  I almost got runout every single time. The game is very baised and have to use the watch add to rewind option. Developers please make changes.,POSITIVE,0,0.956488609,6-Apr-24
Real Cricket GO,Can you make the easy mode a little bit easier? Seriously I'm just trying to have fun man. And also the run out system is abysmal once it gets to third empire. Adding a dive option would be good. But my main concern is the difficulty  I played easy and expert mode and both had the same level of difficulty which is just ridiculous.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998941958,9-Feb-24
Real Cricket GO,This used to be a great game. But ever since the game was updated and squads upgraded  the game took a turn for the worse. Before the update  even hard level of the game was playable. Now however  even medium level is unplayable and CPU oriented. I updated to the new version  but sadly  I'm uninstalling it and reverting to the old version  at least it's less annoying and a lot more enjoyable. Who cares if the players in the old version are now retired? Disappointed! ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.99667716,22-Mar-22
Real Cricket GO,Zero rating only if there was an option for that. Timing bar is inconsistent. Whatever shot we play  there is no consistency for players to play there shots. Controls are too poor. Run/cancel button vanishes. 3rd umpire is a cheat. Even for clear not out  he founds a tape where batsman is short of crease. 6 hitting is just impossible in Normal mode.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999754608,12-May-19
Real Cricket GO,It is the world's best game with in this size. I request to everyone to not give a rating by comparing it with the games having a size of ten time more than it. First take a look on its size and then leave your comment. I believe that its programming was appreciable and credit should be given to its developer. I advise to its developer that your software was very good and try to focused on its improvement. I think the thing which need to be improved was its shot selection. Thanks,POSITIVE,0,0.978016973,3-Aug-22
Real Cricket GO,A complete waste of time. The graphics are the worst and whenever I try to hit a six  the opponent catches it. it is almost impossible to get the batsman bolded  and when they do the batting and try to do a pull shot or something  it never gets caught and and the fielder misses it. I have to give one star to it  because we cannot give zero stars to it and also adds every over. Whenever we try to take an extra run we always get out  and they do not. This was the most irritating game ever.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999815643,16-Dec-23
Real Cricket GO,This game is very annoying to play. Even in the easy mode whatever shot we try   it would directly go straight into the hands of the fielder. Often it would be even very difficult to face the ball at all. Also when we bowl  opponent team would score boundaries very very easily. Overall an average game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998865008,27-Apr-24
Real Cricket GO,1. I think the RC GO game should have the flexibility to change the stadium  dress  team name etc. 2. Also when they have the commentary in other languages also. 3. The controls are little bit harder than other games like WCC. Since we can change the batsman control over the setting  it isn't as good. 4. I think the size of the stadium is too small. Every lofted shot is gonna be 6 and no catches are done by fielders. 5. Lastly  the shots I cannot played by the CPU and it's always perfect.ððð,POSITIVE,0,0.950299382,12-Dec-22
Real Cricket GO,Could be a great game. Batting is fun and quite realistic  except for when it isn't. Quite a few times  shots don't connect when timing is perfect. And sometimes you're caught even when the timing is close to perfect. And bowling is USELESS and super boring. The opponent will middle it  no matter the variation  pace  placement. Even in easy mode. Your only hope is that the batsman don't play shots. What's the point? ð¤·ââï¸,NEGATIVE,1,0.971078932,16-Apr-23
Real Cricket GO,The shots  even when played perfectly  gets you caught. The opponent can even play a pull shot on a Yorker ball  but you can't play the straight drive  you'll get caught. It's irritating when you see the computer doing the things that you can't. Getting a Hair off of a Lion's beard would be an easier task as compared to getting the opponent's wicket. Also Ads after every over? That's too much. Fix it please.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999447644,19-Dec-21
Real Cricket GO,One of the best mobile cricket apps on the market  as i just can't get enough of this app as the AI poses enough of a challenge for level of difficulty  which keeps me coming back for more  and keep on playing with great graphics and with time controls are easy to get the hang  its just of knowing which shot to play for which ball and knowing your line and length when bowling. Would give it 10â­s if i could ðð,POSITIVE,0,0.986904144,1-Sep-22
Real Cricket GO,I'm looking for a nice game to play on the GO! Stop advertising your other game that I won't download. The ad that brings me to the Playstore when I close it  sucks. As for his game  it's awful. Not every short ball is a wide. Everytime my shot goes SLIGHTLY over the shot metre  I get called for a no ball  but the opponent does not. It's difficult to take wickets  even with best bowlers. Add the ability to skip DRS and Run-Out replays/checks. I don't want to wait 3 minutes for a decision.,NEGATIVE,1,0.9949646,28-Nov-21
Real Cricket GO,I am a big fan of this game. Because i like realistic cricket experience. It has many important things like the variation of the bowlers. But there are something that must need to be fixed. This game is updated recently so I was hoping that some new players must be added. But I am really frustrated to see nothing. And there are 5 levels of the game. We generally think that medium level is a little bit of hard and not too much easy to compete. But in this game medium level looks like very hard!,NEGATIVE,1,0.998405993,26-Sep-20
Real Cricket GO,This is game is an excellent game. At first when I played this game and tried to hit a six   the opponent catched the ball . But now I know the trick how to bat. Before playing the game  we have to change the difficulty mode from easy to medium. When we start batting  first we have to select the selection of where the ball goes. Then we have to click on LOFT when the ball bounces. After hitting the shot the ball will go six. In one over I also made 36 runs. This is a wonderful game of 59MB. BYEE,POSITIVE,0,0.999360502,29-Jan-24
Real Cricket GO,Such an annoying game  i liked the gameplay to start with but the game is so biased towards the AI its stupid  they can hit everything for 6 and you just get out  all the umpire decisions go to the ai  etc. Etc.  i wouldnt mind if this was just on hard mode but every difficulty level is the same and doesnt matter which team you pick  have uninstalled,NEGATIVE,1,0.999371827,8-Apr-24
Real Cricket GO,Even though the game looks great and feels great  the mechanics of the game is not great. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE STORAGE ON THIS GAME. The easiest mode of the game is soooo hard and computer oriented  I can't imagine hardcore. Whenever I bowl  the computer always hits six. However when I bat  I always miss the ball or I get out. This game is not for those who want a simple and unbiased game. Play this game only if you like to lose or if you want to watch the computer hit every ball perfectly. 0/10,NEGATIVE,1,0.99260968,17-Aug-22
Real Cricket GO,The game is good 9/10 for the graphics  commentary etc. Amidst all this I have a complaint. No matter what the game level it is   easy or hard or expert it is impossible to bowl the opponent's batsmen . I rarely score wickets but the opponent always scores them even when the game difficulty is easy. Not that I am inexperienced  I have played many cricket video games and have won games in the most difficult of levels. This particular game is the first one I've encountered that is  unwicketable ,POSITIVE,0,0.812803566,23-Apr-22
Real Cricket GO,Completely waste of time. Don't download it. It's grapics are very worst and controlling and shot timing isn't real and it's a kind of computerized. shots and shot directions are fixed and computerized only. If we hit ball in any directions Shots goes in only 2 or 3 directions. Very worst game of cricket i have played. We have to select team every time a new game starts. I am giving 1 star because I can't give less then 1 star. It deserves negetive rating.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999814451,24-Mar-23
Real Cricket GO,More options in shot selections are needed. Pro-joystick and legacy swipe are too complicated and couldn't be handled well on time. Joystick and classic swipe are good to control the game. Graphics are just satisfactory. Graphics are mediocre. Fasten the gameplay. Change/Update the team players. Change the jerseys. Hard mode is too hard  medium mode is easy and easy mode is very easy. Make changes in medium mode. Batsmen are easily hitting 4 6 and scoring runs in medium mode. Restrict it.,POSITIVE,0,0.94965142,8-Jan-21
Real Cricket GO,I took 9 wickets in just 10 overs with 30 runs conceded. But I was not able to break last partnership. The player in at 11 scored 83 of just 41 deliveries. Sounds kind weird but in the end of 20 overs  they scored 178 for 9 wickets. Please fix this issue and keep the timing rate of every batsman properly.,NEGATIVE,1,0.97208041,27-Apr-24
Real Cricket GO,Wrost cricket game ever played in my life. if you will try to hit the ball for a six it gets caught by the fielder or lands in between them  the timing meter always shows shot played early or late  it never shows perfect timing  no celebrating after a 50 or 100  I wasn't able to time the ball in EASY mode. Ridiculous game ever played,NEGATIVE,1,0.999009609,22-Apr-24
Real Cricket GO,It is a waste game never ever install this before seeing the reviews. You cannot even shot a six but the opponents can make every ball as a six. Fielder is always missing every catches. Please don't install this game. Worst game ever. I played 1 match in this game and deleted it because of its worst graphics and computer system. I gave one star because I can't give less than it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999750793,21-Apr-24
Real Cricket GO,Good game.But the main problem is with bowling. The opponent batter punishes every ball though you have changed varieties paces and spin . Even in easy mode  I am unable to take an wicket and opponent batters used to shot 6 in almost every bowl. Please solve this case.,NEGATIVE,1,0.979576468,28-Apr-24
Real Cricket GO,This is a wonderful game. When I tried to hit 6 at six the opponents caught it. But when I visit the help option then I saw that timing is important here. So good timing can score a 6. After this I hit 6 sixes ina over for 17 times. And the graphics are also awsome. So I will rate this game 5 out of 5. It is very funny and enjoyable game for me. And I scored here highest 813 runs in a 50 over match. It is hard to bold a batsman but it is easy to lbw a batsman. So at all it is an incredible game.,POSITIVE,0,0.999669671,24-Apr-24
Real Cricket GO,This is the best ever I played under 50 mb. Who is first time dowloder he never get un happy. But always a con in the best. So there are some problems. 1- When you hit 9 -10 six bowler takes a wicket (but when you hit a big shot) 2 -there is no test cricket 3- there is now review for batter in cut out. Stumping. 4 - there is some bugs in commentry also But overall this is a good game.,POSITIVE,0,0.998140693,17-Apr-24

Real Cricket GO,Worst game ever.. I didn't won a single match because whenever I tried to hit a six or four the opponent catches it and once I was playing the opponent scored 26 runs then I also scored 26 runs it was a tie between us but they showed me the opponent has won because they scored 32 runs means I can't believe that they added 6runs.. It's just a worst game ð¤ð¤,NEGATIVE,1,0.999573648,20-Apr-24
Real Cricket GO,A great game. But in it there should also ba test matches. Graphics are almost good. This game needs to be a little more difficult as I can win it every time. Overall it's good. I usually spend my time while playing it....,POSITIVE,0,0.999653578,17-Apr-24
Real Cricket GO,Batting has improved a bit in new update but bowling is very hard. Opponents keep on hitting sixes even on slower balls and even against the spin. Plz decrease the level of difficulty. No doubt graphics are just amazing. One more is that whenever opponent takes review he becomes notout even if it is clearly visible that he is edged. Plz fix this issue. Even if in easy mode it is very difficult to win.,POSITIVE,0,0.832714021,15-Dec-22
Real Cricket GO,The game has great potential . Loved it but some recommendations : 1. Updating each team squad 2. Adding celebration of batsman and bowler after 50   100 and hat trick. 3. Add more stadiums and pitches must show variation. The difficulty of the game has increased a lot  how can a batsman hit a six by stepping out from a short ball ? The easy mode is quite difficult to play.,NEGATIVE,1,0.987394214,25-Jul-21
Real Cricket GO,Computer is unsuccessful to enjoy us because it play fast when more run and slow when our run is low. Whatever finally wins the computer. So interested player does not want to play.

Real Cricket GO,This is the worst game I have ever played. It was the worst game because whenever I played the 2-over match  at the first over  whenever I tried to play a lofted shot  I always got caught  like I couldn't get it  and when I bowl  the opponent team plays lofted shot and it goes for 6  and nobody of our team catches the ball. And when I bowl  some of my bowls got a no ball call  but it was under the limit of bowling. This game does very discrimination.

Real Cricket GO,This is the worst cricket game I have ever played. I am tapping on the options of front foot  back foot  etc. it is not moving the bat only.

I wished to give it 0 stars but looking at the graphics I gave 1.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999814093,29-Feb-24
Real Cricket GO,Best cricket game in such less memory. Beautiful graphics with top gameplay. You can play at different levels like easy  medium  hard  very hard and expert. So many bowling variations give an extra boost to the game. Different types of actions of bowlers are there. I love this game very much. I am a big fan of Nautilus games. But my one hearty request is that please please introduce a test match mode.,POSITIVE,0,0.999695539,9-Feb-20
Real Cricket GO,The game is enjoyable only if you are batting but bowling is just too difficult in medium and higher difficulty levels  they start hitting sixes from the very first ball and hit almost every ball for a six in death over no matter it's a bouncer  Yorker  slower or faster. Second thing is batting in very easy and easy mode is so easy that you can easily score 300+ in 10 overs but it's very difficult to hit even one six in medium or hard levels  this creates a heavy disbalace in the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996764302,21-Nov-19
Real Cricket GO,I love this offline game it is good and it is so enjoyable . But you have to give some updates and you have to change the game graphics it is only in one graphics since you released the game but it is good you have to give some best controller and you have to change the commentary in various language and you have to reduce the storage from 60 mb to 35-40 mb then it will be good so be careful there is some high graphics game like your company game rc 20 but rc 20 is only good 22  23 24 is waste,NEGATIVE,1,0.84809351,8-Feb-24
Real Cricket GO,Just the game is worst if you will fix it then i will give 4 or 5 star. 1 About the timing when the player get injury by the ball it gives perfect time other wise late or early . And it is ver innoying that when we are caught when it was perfect shot so please fix it also the shots are scripted to when i want to right side it goes left caught out please fix it and also more improve for ai players and also that when we play a shot then they say catch it take perfectly catch please fix it Thy drop,NEGATIVE,1,0.999471962,8-Dec-23
Real Cricket GO,This game according to size(60mb) is very good even deserves 5 stars but the issue with it are: 1) if your opponent plays in loft it means it's six no matter where is ball or anything 2) there's no sense about shots when I try to hit backwards it always gets me out 3)opponent's score always remains more than 150 (in 10 over match) if I play in medium difficulty no matter i bowl Yorker or anything loft means six 4)if you have to chase this score you have to six at least 2 six per over,NEGATIVE,1,0.994906187,31-Dec-23
Real Cricket GO,This game is neither bad nor good but is also waste of time  opponent play pull shot in Yorker ball  graphics are so bad But I can also hit six on every ball but most of the time it is catch out Change the stadium  change the jersey  Give a view on pavilion or dug outs  give meter to show how does far the ball goes when we hit the six. Please do these updates in next update you do Nautilus mobile,NEGATIVE,1,0.999249279,19-Jan-24
Real Cricket GO,The graphics of this game are very good. But  when I play easy mode it is a toss  if the opponent wins the toss  the fielding takes first. Actually it takes 35% of the bat to bowl the opponent  but I don't understand how it gets bowled even if the remaining 65% of the bat is taken. However  if we win the toss  we take the fielding  but in the field of bowling  we could not get out in any way. Bowling slow  spin  medium off side etc. could not get out. In the end  we lost. Really i am not enjoy.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995610535,19-Dec-23
Real Cricket GO,Graphics of the game is not good and it's really annoying when the opponent team takes review it takes a lot of time repeating the same view for 6-8 times and specially when you're playing a tournament you'll play well in the starting good shots and get wickets too but when you entered the knockout you will be dismissed on the shots you hits sixes and fours like you can easily get 25+ runs in an over but you can't hit a single run in the same ball. So it's not a good game totally time waste.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999627829,29-Jun-23
Real Cricket GO,Please read it  it can help you a lot in bowling. I like bowling in the game. Even if it is a little bit hard i atleast take the opponents team down to bring there bowlers. I enjoy batting too  but i think some new shots should be added. And if i talk about bowling  even if i bowl my best still the opponents hit sixes and fours in shots i have never seen while batting. I think the game needs a little more development. If you want to give a 0 ball to the opp put a googly yorker in slowest speed.,NEGATIVE,1,0.992906928,11-Nov-23

Real Cricket GO,Not sure why it wants access to the location and the gameplay is really bad. When the opponent faces a ball he can hit a six but when you play the same type of ball with same type of shot  you either can't play the shot or u get out,NEGATIVE,1,0.999800265,9-Jan-24
Real Cricket GO,Good game! Scope for improvement. Players should show more emotions. Besides  LBW should come into play often than it does. Otherwise DRS is a waste. Also at times it becomes too predictable  easy and boring. Mistakes from batsmen don't come often even when the line  length  direction and speed have been changed by the bowler.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998473585,22-Mar-19
Real Cricket GO,It was difficult to score 4 6 or take wicket in any mode. I feel bad about myself. It was a rigid gameplay. Only batting match  man of the match  30 over match options should be added. Make it easy and fresh. Jerseys  player actions  shots are meant to look nicer. No change for past 1 year in this game. This game was genuine and proper which is the only x factor. I laughed out everytime about the way batsmen runs between the wickets. More stadiums & more players are needed.,NEGATIVE,1,0.981315732,13-Aug-19
Real Cricket GO,The worst out of all. The title is full of irony. You can't play shots after the powerplay is over no matter how hard you try. And if a run out appeal goes to the 3rd umpire then it's always out even if it's unrealistic AF. Bowling control sucks. This game is totally the opposite of it's name. Opponent can play unrealistic shots in crucial moments but you can't.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998164833,6-Apr-19
Real Cricket GO,No  no  no!! ðð Never downlad this game before seeing the reviews.. Ads after every over and nothing modes like Tests  Nets  Profile  Etc.. Only boring ð modes like Associates cup  bla blað¡... How to bowl in this game?? Last two balls of any mode 2 Sixes are fixed.. Playing yorker ball is impossible.. If we bowl that ball they hit six at fine leg.. I just played Two to three matches and deleted.. My friend told me to play RC 20 something like that.. I downloaded it  it was best This game=0st,NEGATIVE,1,0.995691359,24-Apr-24
Real Cricket GO,Shot timing is inconsistent. Regardless of how hard you try  the timings are random and looks like pre calculated. Moreover same timing gives different results: 6  caught  2  4. At times you get a 6 for late or early timing too. Need to improve on shot results. Earlier version had shot making a lot more effective.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997001708,16-Jan-22
Real Cricket GO,As a cricket game  it's impressive but 2 stars gone as when ever the umpire indicates for third umpire decisions  it's a obvious out  also running between the wickets is very risky and rough unlike other games and very difficult to run 2s....also there are specific shots alloted for each direction  the players don't cut the ball but always try to reverse sweep  also even if the timing is perfect  yet the player misses the ball...few of these makes it rage sometimes....,NEGATIVE,1,0.996124327,13-Jun-21
Real Cricket GO,I love this game very much. But there is some problems. First one is I don't decide the captain in my choice. Second one is that all the fast  medium fast bowlers bowling style is same. Also the off leg spinners bowling style is same. There should be more stadium. This game is very good. l think it is good for playing. The hard and expert level is too good.,POSITIVE,0,0.989758015,21-Jul-21
Real Cricket GO,This is the worst game I have ever played. Whenever I hit a six everytime the opponent player catches it and very often the players don't move from their place. And if you hit in a direction but it everytime goes to the another direction.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999788702,29-Dec-23
Real Cricket GO,a very very best cricket that I played ever . As it require no internet connection for playing . It is very easy to hit six runs . It has very easy   easy   normal   hard   expert mode for playing . We can choose our own pitch . Example hard   dry   green pitches for playing. We can also play two   five   ten   etc overs matches .,POSITIVE,0,0.998404682,29-May-19
Real Cricket GO,This game is good for those who have old android and less RAM. But there needs improvements. 1]The opponent batsman always hits the ball when lofted with perfect timing . So if the ball goes up 99.99% it will be a 6. Like all the batsman are like legends of timing . In my experice only 1 time the ball was caught by the fielder.So feild set up is just to show off. 2] Though their is manual feild set up but we cannot place them except the white spots. 3] There is a lot to set before facing a ball.,NEGATIVE,1,0.797241628,23-Mar-21
Real Cricket GO,In medium mode also  the opponents win easily the match. In batting performance  batting shots didn't connect even my shot selections are correct. But for opponent  the timing is always perfect except easy mode. So  your A.I. is worst in the cricket game. I am playing lot of cricket games since 4 years ago  that's why I have experience. Your game was good but not today. Fix your difficulty level and improve your A.I. system.,NEGATIVE,1,0.989585578,4-Jun-21
Real Cricket GO,One of the best games I ve ever played I can't say nothing about it's graphics ...it's really fantastic ð But as some users said batsman must celebrate when they score 50 100 etc..install more shots like reverse sweep  upper cut  etc and different stadiums and when playing tournaments you must show whether it is a pool match or semi final or final And I am giving 5 stars because I can't give more than that âºï¸ In next update install these things,POSITIVE,0,0.81616503,27-Apr-24
Real Cricket GO,I give 3 Stars of this game because when we bat and we do a six the opponent team catch the ball and when opponent team bat first our player miss the catch .

World War: Fight For Freedom,The game has been one of my favorites for a long time now but recently am unable to play a new mission in the campaign mode  it keeps loading and says it's updating content with size 24.2mb the progress bar fills up and starts afresh three to four times and then says I've lost connection  it's quite annoying.

World War: Fight For Freedom,invaded  what will happen? Great science fiction novels explore many scenarios like this. The likelihood of an Alien invasion is still a highly talked about topic in science fiction today. But none approach the subject of alien invasions like The War of the Worlds.

World War: Fight For Freedom,Updated Review: I really like this game. Graphics  controls  overall game play.... EVERYTHING!!!! I've made one purchase  the stop ad one. I'm just at level 30. I'm on mission 5  with all stars achieved before that. I'm getting stronger  and I didn't have to break the bank to do so. As far as ads  you get more optional gains by plowing through them at the end of missions and sub mission. The timed box draw with ads offers needed resources as well. This game it the perfect balance.,POSITIVE,0,0.999176562,5-Nov-22
World War: Fight For Freedom,Good game  but it's meant for left-handed users. Honestly  developers didn't give it much thought I believe  but they could've added one setting.. Ideally  the shooting buttons are always on the right and the navigation/ zoom  etc. is on the left. I didn't even complete the tutorial and uninstalled the game. I may reinstall once that option is provided. Otherwise  it's a pretty decent game to keep you hooked!,POSITIVE,0,0.99858582,1-Aug-22
World War: Fight For Freedom,This is a great game with good graphics. The major problem is it doesn't always give you the money for completing a level  it even let's you watch commercials promising to double your winnings and gives you nothing. Also  aerial enemies have a tendency to disappear into thin air when you're shooting at them and reappear behind you. And finally  my favorite  when you get to advanced stages it takes more shots to kill the soldiers than to take down a plane ð¤£. Fix the glitches I'll give 5 â­'s.,NEGATIVE,1,0.953720391,9-May-21
World War: Fight For Freedom,The game itself is fine. The problem is the ad timing. Mid-way through a level they will show an ad  and for whatever reason  even if I hit the X to close  sometimes it will open up the browser for the ad... or let's just say I wanted to see the ad. Regardless  the problem then is I lose my progress for that level. It's really annoying to the point I am deleting the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99932754,9-Jan-23
World War: Fight For Freedom,It's a decently fun game  I enjoy playing it. However  it's also probably the most ad-heavy game I've played in 10 years. You even get ads mid-gameplay. And of course ads between every mission. And if that wasn't bad enough  when you get the option to X the ad off...it will go to another screen of the ad for 5 seconds  and you then have to X it off. And again. And the area to hit the X is so small  it will take you out of the game to what's being advertised almost everytime you try to X it out.,POSITIVE,0,0.631623685,21-Mar-23
World War: Fight For Freedom,Gameplay itself is decent. Requires a bit of skill and strategy  timing and focus  but is still quite fun. The grind to upgrade weapons is extremely annoying. The only real way you can keep up with the level changes is to spend money on over-priced weapons that quickly become obsolete. Replaying levels only gives you a fraction of the money previously earned there... You will get $3500 but need $250 000 for a single upgrade in later levels.,NEGATIVE,1,0.991234541,6-Nov-22
World War: Fight For Freedom,Fun and simple  perfect for a quick distraction from reality. BUT.... Right in the middle of a wave of mowing down enemies you get a pop-up ad  not before or after  I'm talking about right when you're getting into the game play  AD.! Sorry  I don't mind spend money to support a game but paying to remove an ad that interrupts you in the middle of the game  that's what I call nonsense (extortion.) They are thousands of games available  I'm moving on.,NEGATIVE,1,0.539584339,11-Dec-22
World War: Fight For Freedom,Super fun game to play  but not getting earned rewards and lots of server connection issues. Frustrating. Followup: any glitches in the game seemed to dissapear after paying for no ads. Game was great until getting to the last several campaign maps. The game suddenly started saying I was missing shots when I clearly wasnt. I tried  playing it their way  using only rockets to destroy targets and that wasnt even enough. Deleted for lack of ability to progress. Possibly more money wld fix.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998737156,25-Jul-22
World War: Fight For Freedom,Game is fun and enjoyable  although it gets repetitive (as you continue playing the game and slowly realize that these are the same maps as before) like the maps and the enemy's. It would have been cool if the maps if they introduce new enemy types that are challenging but also an enjoyable experience without it being frustrating and annoying. And also  at least add some events that reward free to play players to grind for it  instead of using their money to buy the good guns.,POSITIVE,0,0.999657869,21-Jun-22
World War: Fight For Freedom,If you want a simple  no-nonsense turret shooter  this is for you  though I would highly recommend paying $1 to disable the in-game ads between every wave (very annoying  but the game IS worth the dollar in my opinion). You can watch the ads for further upgrades  etc.  but not entirely necessary. There is a chat function for some reason  but no multi-player. No strategy playing here  just straight shooting.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995542347,23-Nov-22

World War: Fight For Freedom,Fun game a bit glitchy at times but that is probably because I don't spend any real $$$ and or I have an archaic phone! The game has a tendency to reboot after ads. Especially frustrating when the ads pop up between rounds 1 & 2  but not a deal killer. Two Improvements IMHO would be; Have a way to select specific targets for bazooka rockets. Have a way to purchase gold coins with in game money.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998947561,11-Feb-23

Locations are actually well made  lots of different enemy types (didn't expect to fight Messerschmits  Mystery Machines  forklifts and walking trailers at allð).

World War: Fight For Freedom,Very simple shooter game. Others complain about the ads popping up in the middle of a battle but it's in-between round 1 and round 2 and the ads are only about 15 seconds and it returns to the exact same place. I fonri d a 15-30 second ad if it means getting 2x-3x the normal reward for completing a mission. I have not experienced any if the issues other players are talking about.

World War: Fight For Freedom,Just into it so this may be a bit premature. However my first impression was  how in the hell did I miss this action?! Got too complacent gunning zombies I suppose.

World War: Fight For Freedom,The current stars for this game must be fake  there is no way that this has 4 stars from normal players. It's an awful game which is  quite frankly  from the 1990's rather than 2022. Left handed controls with no options to change and a very cluttered screen.

World War: Fight For Freedom,The games fun  I'm dinging it kinda rough because through the course of playing  the control layout needs to be completely reworked.

So  if the developers could consider a redesign to the layout that would improve the game play and raise my rating.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999752462,7-Dec-21
World War: Fight For Freedom,Seems to be a stationary shooter with misdesigned controls. The tradeoff between aim speed and precision does not really work out here as the weapon turret turns much too slow to cover the immensely wide area you have to guard. Left handed controls may also not work for everyone and some kind of attack marker to show where the last enemy out of sight actually is might help a lot.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999792993,24-Sep-22

But other than that this is an amazing game ð (never delete this game please),POSITIVE,0,0.502608836,4-Apr-24
Roblox,"What it roblox?

Roblox is a massive multiplayer online game creation platform.
People can come in and they can create games  alot of people spend alot of their time playing games. There's a wide variety of games  and they are  so many of them  they're intended for a wide age range from   Jailbreak   to   Meep City   to  Working at a pizza place.  There are so many different types of games it's like having a console. There's so many different games that you can buy for that console and all of the games are different. The Gameplay is what most people end of doing in the platform. (Playing Games)

Game Creation (Computer only)

Games are created by people  they can come on  Roblox Studio   and they can create any world they want. They can build terrain  the can move objects around  they can change the color of objects  pretty much anything that they can imagine  they can create  and they can put that game out there so more people play it  and the can even earn money by other people playing those games  they also have a avatar  each person has a character  which they can customize  they can also purchase an ingame currency know as   Robux   with real money  and they can use it to dress their avatar. They can get free items as well  there's a wide range of prices for the items that you can get for your avatar  but basically you have to spend money for some of them. There's also   Events   where people can do activities that will make them get a free item as a part of the event.

The Community

There's also a community aspect because people are playing the games. They're playing these game   Online   so people can   chat   with other people that are on their friends list  and they can talk to people inside the games. Most words and things like personal information end up being   Hashtagged and censored out (#)  but Roblox does care about online privacy safety. Just like anything else  like the internet  this could almost be a description of how we would pay attention to what our kids are doing on the internet as a whole. Just like as a parent you want to be aware what websites or apps your kids are going to  you also want to make sure who your kids are talking to on Roblox. You can also make sure they don't talk to anybody  and you can kind of control what kind of games they play.

Privacy and Safety

So the   Settings   is one of the most important parts of keeping your child safe  that parents should pay attention to. If you go into Settings and you go into    Privacy   you can set it up so that nobody can communicate with your kids through the chat. You can set these settings  so that people cannot communicate with your child. So people can be friends  and they can follow each other in these games  so they can set it so everyone can follow them in a game  or just friends  or just people who follow them  or you can set it up so nobody can follow them in the games. You can also do the same with chatting. You can make it  so that your child cannot do any chatting at all. There's also a security aspect as a parent. If you don't want your kids coming and messing with these privacy setting  you can go to  Security Settings   and set a four-digit   Pin   that must be known in order to access any of these Privacy Settings. You can go and make it  so your child account is set under the age of 13. There are certain games if the birthday entered under 13 that will be blocked right away. Certain phrases  certain settings  basically it's enforcing for under the age of 13  A certain level of privacy  and security  and protection. So if you you want to allow your child  or whoever has the account the access all of the games  you have to make sure the date of the birthday is over 13  but make sure you can go in there and change those settings. So as a parent just make sure you are cognizant of what your kid is playing. Roblox is COPPA Compliant  which is the   Children's Online Privacy Protection Act   it is all about online safety  and security for children when they are using the Internet  and Roblox is compliant with that.

End

Overall Roblox is safe  but you need to be aware anything your kids are doing online  make sure you are aware of the games they're playing  make sure they're going the websites  and apps that are allowed and aren't inappropriate. So just be cognizant about what your kids are doing online  basically this is no different to having access to Roblox  than having a Xbox  or a PlayStation  or having another game console  because people are playing with other people Online  and are communicating  and stuff like that  so this is no different.

Roblox,Roblox is a really fun game its like one big program that has a ton of other games on it to play and you can create your own game to! You also have an avatar and can change it with robux.

Roblox,So it banned me for saying OHð and it actually banned me for life which was really anoying because I had alot of progress on a game called booga booga (insanly big fan of that game all I play) and I spent 5k robux on it........ And lost it all..... So pretty upset and it does updates but it changes nothing :\ and I don't know if its like my I pad or the Appstore or roblox its self but it doesn't let me update it so I couldn't play it for 3 months until some how it worked (makes no sence) but ya so now its updating again and I really wanna play it but I can't and I don't know how long its going to be until I can update it and this time I spent 12k robux...........(hundreds of dollers) so ya :\ also uh like there's this online dating game called ro meet talk to strangers... People ask for personal info on that game.. And people want to know your number to meet up in real life.. Im private schooled and I would definitely not recommend this game to any one that's not a public schooler its also insanly idicting so you can see some uh strange.. Stuff and since its so idicting u can't stop playing roblox its so fun I love (SOME) of the games on it and its not a bad game if you don't look or type anything inappropriate so I would not reccomend for children not in middle school but ya over all its a really fun game but it just depends on the game you play and the stuff u say so weather its goid or bad its really actually what u do and play so I don't think the game its self is bad but I do think the games in it and the chat is pretty bad.....,NEGATIVE,1,0.999351084,6-Feb-24
Roblox,"Sometimes it's very glitchy but  ok for fire tablets

Roblox,The game's really nice but there's a couple problems for me. I can't play games because it says something is wrong with my internet but its perfectly fine or it lags me out of the game  so I have to rejoin or reload my page. Also I could join a friend but it says there server is full when but then I check the server they are in it say 20/30 people for example.

Roblox,Ok  I love roblox so much! But there's issues starting off with the fact that on the other fire tablet I use(this is my sibling's) it won't let me download it which is so frustrating because I've had roblox on MY fire tablet for ages and when I tried to update it it wouldn't update which got me so angry. And when I tried downloading it on here it downloads but it glitches a lot! And I have stable internet connection so what's the issue? And I dislike all the lagging and stuff it's so annoying! I love roblox very much but sometimes I can dislike it because of all this lagging and other issues going on with it...âºï¸ðð¥ð¡,NEGATIVE,1,0.98683387,14-Apr-24
Roblox,I absolutely LOVE this game  I play it so much but I do wish there was a way to Sell Stuff that you don't want that's in your inventory for the amount of Robux it costs to buy it  but anyways Roblox does tag SO MUCH and half the time its not inappropriate it even tags things such as  ig  or  rn  and WAY more that's REALLY annoying  I understand that Roblox is just trying to be Kid Friendly and it does filter bad stuff but it filters not bad stuff SO much.Also I don't know if this is just his tablet (he has the same one as me) but my brother tried uploading roblox after not playing in like  3 months or more so then we tried deleting Roblox and re-downloading it but now it won't download!!Also Ive had this going on for a while  my account's  age option  changed one day I cant get it to go back and now I cant even play so much Loved Games of Mine!(I CANT EVEN PLAY 9+ GAMES AND HALF OF THEM DONT EVEN DESERVE 9+ SUCH AS EVADE)As said before  I love this game so much but it could really improve!!

Hungry Shark Evolution,This game is just fantastic! It's a blast to play  even though you have to put in some effort. But that doesn't diminish how great it is. The game offers such a wide variety of experiences  and the events and extra features they've added are really cool. The whole idea behind it is so creative  and the gameplay itself is just stellar! The only hiccup I've encountered is when you approach a cage with scuba divers â it starts glitching and spinning uncontrollably. If it hits you  your shark gets sent below the map  and you're stuck with no way to escape.,POSITIVE,0,0.999405742,24-Apr-24
Hungry Shark Evolution,First off  I am brand new to the Hungry Shark series of games so this review is from the perspective of someone who has never played the game's predecessor versions.  This game was purchased and installed on the Amazon Fire TV Gaming Edition.Any game in which you role-play a hungry shark intent on devouring anything and everything in your path will start off preliminarily with high marks in my book.  That being said  concept is one thing  execution and delivery is another.  Future Games of London has succeeded in delivering a totally excellent  fun game to Amazon Fire users that will keep you playing for hours.  Imagine a 'third person shooter' style of game where instead of a gunman chasing after targets  you are a shark trying to stay alive as long as you can by eating fish  people  other sea creatures  and avoiding bigger fish/creatures  poisonous jellyfish and man-o-wars  harpooning fishermen  and underwater mines.You start the game as a reef shark and spawn in a relatively docile area of the game map populated by tropical fish  sea turtles  and beach-goers.  The shark loses health with time  and the only way to replenish it is to eat more and more of the sea creatures.  By eating  your shark will level up and grow stronger.  Two forms of currency can be collected in the game (or purchased within the app): coins and gems.  Use coins and gems to unlock gear for your shark (weapons or defensive equipment  or enhancement items) or upgrade your shark's bite  speed  and  boost.   Once your reef shark reaches full size ( level 10+ ) the next shark becomes available for purchase using in-game currency.  Each successive shark has different attributes (generally speaking  is stronger in significant ways but may also have comparative weaknesses) and spawns in a different location on the map.  The longer you stay alive  the harder it is to stay alive.Using each shark  you can complete missions/quests that range from easy to challenging.  There are also unique relics littered throughout the world map (a total of fifteen)  and there are 'boss' creatures to seek out and engage in battle.  As you progress through the game  you go from role-playing a reef shark to a mako shark  hammerhead  tiger shark  and great white shark.  Beyond the great white shark  there are special sharks to unlock such as the legendary megalodon (a very large extinct prehistoric shark)  dunkleosteus  and mosasaurus (the latter two being code-named Big Daddy and Mr. Snappy).You could play the entire game from beginning to end content without investing real world money into purchasing in-game currency.  However  it would take hours upon hours upon hours of 'grinding' to achieve enough coins and gems to unlock content that most users would find desirable.  In the end  if you value your time and you find the game to be enjoyable enough to play in your spare time  it would likely be in your interest to speed your progression by purchasing certain necessary upgrades (such as unlocking sharks or helpful items) and avoid needless grinding.  The replayability of the game will not be hurt by doing this.Lastly but not least is the points system.  You score points by eating things  with the opportunity to score combo points (up to 96x with Mr. Snappy) when you consume things in rapid succession.  You can also enter 'gold rush' mode which greatly enhances both your collection of currency in the game and also the opportunity to accumulate points and trigger additional subsequent combos.  Your ability to make and beat high scores is largely determined by how effective you are at triggering combos and using 'gold rush' mode to maximize your point accumulation in-game.  Of course  the longer you stay alive  the bigger a 'survival' bonus you get -- did I mention it gets harder and harder to stay alive the more time passes?Overall  this is an excellent game  truly one of the best games released on the Amazon Fire platform.  If you enjoy arcade style shoot-em-up (or eat-em-up) games  that are challenging  fun  have some degree of depth (ha ha) to them  and enable you to post stats  then this is a great game for you.  This game is also cross-platform  as it is available on the web and through iOS  Google Play  and Amazon Underground on Android devices.  The game also allows you to connect a Facebook account and compete against Facebook friends who are also playing.  However  I do not know if this is available on the Fire TV version of the game as I have not figured out how to do this yet.Bottom line:  A great buy!  It definitely rivals or surpasses many full priced console games for Xbox or PlayStation.,POSITIVE,0,0.99495703,9-Nov-15

Geometry Dash Lite,This is an awesome game that I  totally recommended to cure your boredness.  The levels start out easier and gradually grow harder. Each level is more difficult than the last. The best thing about this game is you never get tired of it! Sometimes  I catch myself playing this game for a whole hour. It passes time amazingly. ð  You can also design your little block character thing. You can change its face and color. You unlock them as you get further on the level s  which is cool because you don't just get them all when you get the game; you have to unlock them the better you do  I guess you could say.  There's also something that looks like a small diamond  called the practice mod e. This really helps you if you want to  get to know  the level. It really helped me  especially when I took like at least a week doing the level  Dry Out . I used the practice mode five times and it really helped me finish it. There's also like smaller diamonds  that spawn as you go thru the practice level. When you break  those diamonds spawn you back to that place. That also really helped me because there's was this one part I had a lot of trouble with and luckily  one of my miniature diamonds spawned there. I went over that a couple of times and FINALLY got it. What I'm trying to say is that the practice mode really helps you with the harder levels.  (Something else about the pracfice mode diamonds is that at the bottom of your screen  there's something that is a crossed out diamond. If you push it  it erases the last small diamond that spawns you.So if you don't like where you're spawning  you can push the crossed out diamond and it erases THAT diamond and leads you to the One before the erased diamond. I hope this helps something and isn't confusingð).  Another thing (not really important  but something you should know about because I didnt)  is that there's something called the progress bar. Not a huge thing but its cool because it shows where you leave off in that level. During the level  it's at the top of your screen and shows you how long you have until the end. That sort of motivated me to do better and get to the end and I hope it motivates those who.play this game.  One more thing is  if you finish this Geometry Dash Lite game  there's technically a number two! Its like five times harder than this one  but with less levels. So if you finish this ENTIRE game and you want a challenge  download the 2nd Geometry Dash (Idk what its called...Thats Info I can't help withð).  I truly recommend this game for anyone. It's fun  amsuing  cool  and every good thing a game like this should have. 5 STARS!!ð Thanks for making such a great game!!ð,POSITIVE,0,0.988785028,10-Jun-23
Geometry Dash Lite,This game is AMAZING!! So many levels such as Stereo Madness  Back On Track  Polargeist  Dry Out  Base After Base  Can't Let Go  Jumper and Time Machine! So many to choose from.

Geometry Dash Lite,This game is great for passing the time  especially when you're trying to beat each level. Even on my old phone  it runs smoothly without any glitches. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of this one ad that keeps popping up like a leech. After closing it twice  it redirected me back to the game three times  messing up my gameplay. Reloading the app didn't fix it. While the ads can be a bit annoying  they're usually not too intrusive. One issue I have is with the auto checkpoints â sometimes they spawn me right before a spike or during a jump  causing me to die over and over again. I've tried turning them off and setting checkpoints manually  but it's too difficult to do while concentrating on the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.868285358,13-Apr-24
Geometry Dash Lite,This game's a blast and helps with timing  but there's this annoying thing: when my battery gets low  like around 10 percent  The previous version which it started glitching like crazy. Even if I'm already out in the game  the music just keeps blaring. I've tried everything to fix it - restarting my phone  clearing space  making sure my internet's strong - but no luck  it's still acting up. Despite that  the new update makes me still think it's a solid game and worth giving a try. If you don't have the same issue as me  go ahead and dive in.,NEGATIVE,1,0.631532967,25-Mar-24

Word Trip,This game offers an excellent way to occupy yourself when you're bored or seeking a brain-teasing challenge. As depicted in the game's ads  it provides you with multiple letters to create words containing three letters or more.

Word Trip,This game is very nice to play  especially when I'm really bored. The levels are very easy at first  and start getting harder and harder. There are also thousands of levels as well. Its funny  you know a word  and you completely mispronounce it in your mind. And a heads up  if you get this app it has a couple words  like  if I can remember  there may be an Indian word. But anyways  I really enjoy this game. I would really recommend it  there is also an app similar to this  and it's called wordscapes it would probably be easier to figure some words out in the because the words cross through each other  but I like a  challenge!

Word Trip,"I've played this for a year and recently made it through all the countries but I have not played since and will be removing this app after leaving the review.

I guess it was 2-3 months ago they made changes and now force advertising at the bottom of each game played unless you pay them money. Also now forced are ads in between games. What made it even more aggravating is that in some ads where an x was displayed in the top  it is supposed to close it out  but instead many times it forced a link to whatever game had just been advertised. In addition  the forced ads in between games count against your time when you have been granted so many minutes to use points at half the amount needed for clues. And while it doesn't affect me  many ads could cause problems with those who have epilepsy and no warnings are provided.

Prior to these changes  I enjoyed the game enough to regularly play on an almost daily basis  even though you'd have to watch some ads to spin the wheel  etc. When these changes took place  I didn't want to delete the game then as I was close to completing the countries. When you finish the 178 countries  don't expect anything special. There's no extra tokens or anything else- just a congratulations message.

Wordscapes,"Update: I have stuck with two  PeopleFun  games for several months now (Wordscapes and Wordscapes in Bloom)  and have just removed them both from my device in order to eliminate one aggravation from my life. After getting an update last week  both games have begun crashing even MORE often than before  sometimes not allowing me fifteen seconds to think about forming the next word. The reloads take several minutes  so that for every minute I spend in actual play  I am spending four or five minutes waiting for the game to boot up or unfreeze. I have better things to do with my time than waste it on PeopleFun's games.

I have several issues with this word game. First of all  if it's given the opportunity  it will drown you in obnoxious advertising. You can get around this to some extent by playing without having your device connected to the internet (in my case  a Kindle)  but then every time it tries to access an ad  the game freezes up and has to be restarted. It does so frequently  and it seems to me that the farther you advance in levels  the longer it takes to restart.

That said  my main objection is that  like many word games on the market today  it is very arbitrary with respect to words it accepts and rejects. Wordscapes allows  lat  (if not an abbreviation for  latitude   the only other definition is an East Indian tree) and  poon   which is also an East Indian tree  but has an extremely vulgar meaning which returned to the US with the soldiers of the Viet Nam war. Many other potentially vulgar or rude words are considered unacceptable even when they have a legitimate alternate meaning  e.g.  coon  as the shortened form of  raccoon.  The game accepted  caliche  (a soil type) and yet refused  gannet  (a bird); it won't take  tat  (a form of needlework which  incidentally  is something I do for a hobby). I realize that any game must be played by the rules it sets  but couldn't this one at least be consistent in what it permits?

Another point against this game is the fact that you accumulate prize money in a piggy bank until it is full (1440 cents)  and then you are asked to pay to open it with real money (not your winnings) if you wish to purchase a hint pack. However  hints can be bought from another  pocket  of virtual coins on an individual basis. That said  if you do decide to purchase a hint pack  beware. The game will update as soon as you connect with its store  and you'll spend your next session closing down ads by the dozen. I wish they had given us the option to purchase an  ad-free  version  but sadly  one is not available.

So: four stars for fun (it is addictive)

Wordscapes,Awesome game!!  I've been playing for years.  Many great changes and advertisements over time!  After a couple years of play  I paid the one time fee to remove advertisements. Definitely worth it!!  Now you get prizes it you choose to watch advertisements. Worked at first  but now you watch the video  the game claims to give a reward  but like Willy Wonka says...  YOU GET NOTHING!! YOU LOSE!! GOOD DAY SIR!!  Will update to five stars when this glitch gets fixed!!,POSITIVE,0,0.997861087,23-Feb-24

Hangman Word Game,I don't know why Amazon wants a photo of this but hey  don't have one cause it's on the firestick. Anyhoo my grandchildren and I during lockdown get quite a kick out of playing this. It's a good game for kids learning words  sometimes big words. My six year old granddaughter is increasing her vocabulary  and learning to spell at the same time. The eleven year old has learned a few sophisticated words also. So if you are home with the kids say to about 11years old give it a try  it's animated and very appealing.,POSITIVE,0,0.999304891,30-Aug-20

Hangman Word Game,I'm not the smartest person in the world but I'm pretty smart and this is way over my head (I managed to squeak my way through a BA with honors from a local university five years ago). I only played it once and there were words that I never did figure out (and they don't tell you the answer if you don't get it)  and a few that I happened upon that I've never even heard. I was expecting  capitals  to be of the US but they're not  they're of the world. There are animals I've never heard of in the game.

My Talking Tom 2,when I was younger  I was absolutely hooked on this game. It had this amazing feature where getting those super rare items was a real challenge  and it would take ages to finally snag one. I'd spend hours grinding away  hoping to strike gold  and there was nothing cooler than showing off those rare finds to my friends. But now  they've completely messed it up with this update. Every item is just meh  no rarity at all  and they're all crazy cheap  like 3 to 10 coins. It's such a disappointment because there's no thrill in the hunt for rare stuff anymore. It's a major letdown,NEGATIVE,1,0.999319911,25-Mar-24

In my opinion Out of all the Outfit7 creations ever THIS is the best. If you rate it 1 star there is a 99% chance that you don't hate the game itself but you just watched those  stalker in his eye  theories and then you miraculously made up a story typed it on the review posted it and terrified some 5 year olds.

My Talking Angela 2,So  I've had talking Angela downloaded for a while now  and it wasn't until today my little sister played it. It started acting strange. It always asked for camera permission more than once. Even when I said no. Then when my sister was done playing. SUDDENTLY a bunch of ads popped up and random app started downloading on my ipad. There was one named  robo qr scanner . I was wondering what this app was and I checked the review  turned out it was a tracker. And when I tried installing talking Angela and most of the apps  IT WOULDN'T WORK!! I HAD TO RESTART MY IPAD AND LOG OUT AND IT TOOK ME LIKE ABOUT AN HOUR I also don't like how there are ads every second and forces you to download them. I saw some pretty bad things about talking Angela already but I should have listened. I regret installing this.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998386979,28-Mar-24

My Talking Angela 2,Is a good game but sometimes Angela can be annoying I don't really like the sound she makes it's annoying and kind of weird There is a lot of ads So As A lot of us we hate ads so Yeahð idk I like dressing her up but I don't even smack her once or hit her because the sound she makes is just so annoying there's no reason to do that plus she makes these weird faces that I don't like But the games overall okay I like it... The other part is Probably a lot of you know about the rumors of a man In Angela's eyes I don't know if it's true but I don't see any man in her eyes she seems over okay I never saw Speak to her And when she repeats she has this really weird high pitch voice I don't like and it's literally like that for all of the talking whatever gamesð But she doesn't seem sus to me So I think she's fine I don't think there's a man attached to her eyes or someone watching með But yeah the game is good or All right I could sayð There might be a man in the eye for you guys or some violence or whatever idk But stay safe out thereðHave a great night day or noon or Whateverð¶And I think I'm safe Hopefullyð²Anyways this is my review I hope this was helpful To you bye!ð,POSITIVE,0,0.981469631,3-May-23
My Talking Angela 2,Okay so I'm going to be very harsh on this rating.  There is no hackerman in her eyes OK? It's just a rumor that is passed around since 2019 and if you think that it is true just believe that a that it's not true. Trust me I have been playing these types of games for since 2011!! There is no man in ginger Angela tom Ben's eyes okay? It's just a rumor and it is not true I've seen it from myself and believe me I've had experience in these games. Many people believe that The fact that you can hit the characters is weird. When my little sister played it and hit tom in the balls  She laughed ever so hard!! It's probably just to make little ones laugh!! Because you know it's kind of funny!! They also think the noises they make are weird. True Angela's noises can be a little bit weird even when you hit her they can be annoying. I have no claim and how to answer this but there is no man in their eyes and the slapping thing is just to make little ones laugh because they actually kind of like it!! And yes I am defending outfit 7.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999314547,18-Dec-23

My Talking Angela 2,"I really like this game. I especially love dressing Angela. The only thing I will say about the clothing options is that they should add some new clothes. I think the sound effects Angela makes are very unneeded and make the game play kinda weird.If your going to play with sound on where headphones. I love that you can travel but I do wish there where more than three options at a time you can travel to.If your playing with internet there will be ads. When I play I normally turn off the Internet on my device so I don't get ads.
If you are playing online there aren't enough ads to make the game Unenjoyable.

My Talking Tom Friends,Refrain from downloading this game due to its tracking features. I've scrutinized several games advertised as kid-friendly  and there appears to be something dubious in the characters' eyes  hinting at a potential hacker or threat. Furthermore  during gameplay  you may notice your reflection in a window. Upon further investigation  it has come to light that the game possesses the ability to hack into your device  gathering information. Exercise caution  particularly during nighttime play,NEGATIVE,1,0.991167665,12-Jan-24
My Talking Tom Friends,This super-cute game is well worth your time.  As a adult I'm a complete failure at all those stressful shoot people in the back games.  I love these cute little characters  rather too many cats  but I like them all.  It is simple  relaxing  fun and innovative.  I bought the the ad-free option and it was worth it as it is easy to  aquire  the in-game coins and cheap to buy necessities with them. Safe for kids but the online videos for the franchise are more for adults  which is questionable. Kids  be kind and be nice.  If it looks harmful  don't do it.

My Talking Tom Friends,It's good for the most part but one thing. My 6 year old came into my room asking what year she was born. I asked why and she said cause the game wants to know! I didn't like that. I just told her to put my year and she did. Also she told me it kept freezing and she would have to turn her tablet on and off multiple times while playing. I tried it out and had the same problem. She also told me Tom and Angela take too long to complete tasks. She said she liked it because there were fun mini games and the animals did funny things sometimes. Like with the gameboard Angela jumped on top of it and juggled the dice. She also likes how they make cool shapes in the sandbox. All in all from what my daughter says this is cool and fun game. I recommend for ages 3 and up.,NEGATIVE,1,0.955790937,16-Jun-23

My Talking Angela,"So the game would be pretty fun if it wasn't spying on you... I've been SUPER creeped out on this game many times. Here's some things that happened...
So me and my sister were playing this game and when we were doing her photo shoot HER EYEBALLS FELL OUT????!!!! I thought it was a glitch but it happened again the next day and when she was dancing.
And once I noticed a reflection in her eyes when I was brushing her teeth. I thought maybe she was looking in the mirror and the reflection in her eyes was herself  but the reflection wasn't a cat  it was a human. So was the reflection in her eyes ME??!!

This game is very creepy and maybe someone is spying on you from Angela's eyes. So if you do want to download this game I suggest you put a sticker over your camera on your device and NEVER turn on the mic when the game asks you to. But I'm giving 2 stars because the game is fun but super scary.",NEGATIVE,1,0.995581686,1-Apr-24

MLB,"I failed to write a review on this app during the 2017 baseball season but if I had  it would definitely have been 5 stars. I was totally satisfied with the app and it worked perfectly at all times. Move ahead to this season  2018 and I give it 1 star and it may be my last season subscribing to this app.

I have two Fire TV devices and two Fire Stick devices  all connected via HDMI to my TV's and all have the same problems when attempting to watch games. I have contacted MLB Customer Support several times in the past two months with limited help from their customer support. During my last contact they finally admitted there is currently a software problem  which I believe coincided with their last software update at the end of March. They assured me that their technicians were working on it and they apologized numerous times but could not estimate when it would be corrected. They assured me that the problem was not on my end as far as streaming or download speeds. My call was escalated to their MLB Advanced Support and I repeated my problem again in detail. Later that day I received a call from advanced support inquiring as to the version of software in my Fire TV Device. They promised to email or call me with a solution. I never received either.

Like written in other recent reviews  I can be watching a game for just several minutes or even several innings and all of a sudden the app starts buffering. This usually follows with either going back to the game live and missing that previous part of the game; or going back to the app's home screen and having to start over; or sometimes you will get a pop-up message that MLB is not available at this time  try again later. It is impossible to watch a baseball game this way. I have many apps on these devices including Amazon Prime Video  ESPN  Netflix  Showtime  etc. I never experience any buffering problems or any interruptions during their playback.

If you do a search on the Roku Forum you can read the same complaints subscribers are having with their app using MLB.TV. Search both Amazon and Roku Forums but sort by recent reviews  since reading older reviews will usually be positive and not mention problems that are occurring this season.

Cancellation with a pro-rated refund is not an option with a yearly contract. I don't believe Amazon should share any blame for this problem but I do feel they should put some pressure on MLB.TV to take charge of this problem and get it fixed.

MLB.TV recently was part of a settlement agreement in a class action lawsuit regarding their price increases. Are they putting themselves in the position of being part of another class action lawsuit for not providing acceptable service to their customers who are still required to pay for it?",POSITIVE,0,0.997965574,16-Jun-18
MLB,I have a Kindle Fire HD - the  First Generation  of the Fire HD.  I also have the original Kindle Fire.  They're older  but they're work horses.  Because this app is streaming intensive  I was mildly concerned about the quality the app would produce on them  but since it was free to install  I took a shot and installed the  At Bat  app.  I have an MLBtv Premium membership  so once I log in  I get the full access to what MLBtv has to offer.  I noticed that you can buy the premium access through the app  but I haven't tried it - I simply log in to the account I set up online with MLBtv directly.I'm glad I installed it!  My HD is primarily used by my kids for games (it has the 'Free Time'  which the original Fire doesn't support)  so I first tried it on my old 1st Gen Fire.  It works pretty well.  There are times  especially at the beginning of the stream  where the video is a bit twitchy  but it smooths out and then works just fine  especially if you reboot to get rid of everything else first.  I'm very happy with it.  On my HD  the app works perfectly.  The great picture combines with the awesome battery life  delivering an awesome experience when watching a game.I have a windows 8 tablet  also.  The app for the Kindle has far more features than the app available in the MS Marketplace.  Even my older kindle fire provides a better experience than I can get through the windows 8 app.I'm very happy with this app  and would heartily recommend it to anyone.,NEGATIVE,1,0.987263024,9-May-14
MLB,Well - FOR ME - it looks like they finally got it right.  The latest update was automatically uploaded to my Amazon Firestick on July 3rd.  The way I found out  was an email stream I started about a month ago with MLB.TV.  The old APP just plain stunk.... really  really stunk.  Massive buffering issues on both the Amazon Firestick and Roku streaming devices.  Opened a help desk ticket  and after about a week of going back and forth  I heard nothing more.  I proved it wasn't a provisioning issue with my Internet provider.  Had the statistics to prove it.  They then went dark..... 3 weeks went by with NO responses  and then I get an email - that a new version of the APP was available (and that email - came after I had prompted them for information since they hadn't responded in 3 weeks.  The MLB.TV APP had autoupdated to my firestick on July 3rd.  I've been doing IT for 35 years and cybersecurity for 15 of those years.  So in an abundance of caution I did the following (all on the Amazon Firestick);1) Cleared the Data and the Cache2) Deinstalled the MLB.TV APP (cleared it from my  cloud  as well)3) Restarted my Amazon Firestick4) Installed the MLB.TV APP5) Cleared the Data and the Cache again6) Restarted my Amazon Firestick7) Started the APP  Logged in and presto change'o  it's workingI have now watched about 2+ games  and there has been NO BUFFERING issues at all.  None...  Zero...  Zilch... The Big Bagel... So enjoyable now.  I am just giving 4 stars due to the rather lackadaisical manner in which they communicated with me after I had proved it wasn't my internet connection  or the streaming devices.  I'll leave the APP aesthetics to others.  For me  it is functional and provides the game experience the way I expected.  In other words  looks like they got it right.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998478591,6-Jul-18
MLB,"I purchased a Google Nexus 7 tablet only to find out after getting it the os used in it did not support the Adobe Flash required to receive Mlb At Bat. My mistake. I should have researched that before buying the tablet. However  not being one to give up easily I went to youtube and looked for installing Adobe Flash player on Android. Sure enough there was a video showing a workaround for this incompatibility issue.

I ended up with Adobe Flash player version AND11 1 115 27 Linux 3.1.10g22b4fcd using a Mozilla Firefox browser. This works absolutely terrific with streaming live games using the Amazon app. Actually  I'm really not sure if the app wouldn't have worked if I tried to install it without installing the Adobe Flash first as I had already installed the flash before finding the app on Amazon. That being stated  if you're like me and have a device running Android version 4.2.1  and have trouble with this app  do as I did and go on youtube and look for the workaround to install Adobe flashplayer on your device.

I watched two live spring training Cardinal games over the weekend  and except for a couple of interruptions from Mlbtv to rate the video playback during between inning breaks everything was great. The HD quality and smoothness of the video was outstanding. I only hope it's this good when the regular season starts. Go Cards!!",NEGATIVE,1,0.999260128,25-Mar-13
MLB,After I bought a Samsung QLED tv for big bucks  I learned it wasn't supported by MLB and I had to buy an Amazon Fire stick  which has been very unreliable and frustrating: picture freezes frequently.

Amazon suggests unplugging  system for 30 minutes  which didn't work and MLB said a technician would get back to me - never did on 2 occasions,NEGATIVE,1,0.999673963,1-Aug-22
MLB,"I have a separate MLB.TV subscription and the MLB app does not currently support login options for MLB.TV. Only prompts for you to sign up for a MLB.TV subscription through Amazon Prime. Login options need to be added or a separate MLB.TV app added to or back to the app store.

*** Crisis averted. The app has now been updated to recognize your own MLB.TV credentials. Good to go now.",NEGATIVE,1,0.997632146,4-Jun-23
MLB,"I love having access to out of network games so I can watch the games I want that I otherwise wouldn't be able to. Especially late in the season leading up to the playoffs  I like to be able to keep up with the league leaders and wildcard races  and this allows me to watch all of them whenever I want. If there are multiple games I want to watch  I can watch one live and since they record the games  I can watch the recording of another game.

I mostly use the app for streaming on the firestick. I have a very good internet connection/speed  but the games do occasionally end up a little blurry or choppy because of bandwidth issues. It usually resolves within a matter of seconds but sometimes can last for minutes  or the game will completely cut out and send me back to the menu  but this happens very rarely.

The user interface/set up on the app for the firestick that I use is very easy to navigate. It's very simple and straightforward.It makes it easy to quickly find the games I'm looking for. You can navigate to past games as well as viewing games for the current day. Each game in the menu has a preview  showing when the game is scheduled along with some other information like starting pitchers  w/l records  etc. If the game is currently airing  it will say live in highlighted blue text  and will show you the current score and inning. If the game is complete  it will display the final result as well as some other information.

I highly recommend this app to any hardcore fan because. The app itself is free to download  and offers free games of the day along with previews of the games such as information and scores without paying. But for viewing games  you need an annual paid subscription which is renewed automatically unless you manually cancel. There is a set annual price  but occasionally if you start your subscription in the middle-end of the season  there may be a discounted price for that year  then the regular rates will be billed to your payment method the following season.

Being able to watch any game whenever you want is totally worth the price  which isn't that expensive. I highly recommend this app.",POSITIVE,0,0.998039544,13-Sep-19
MLB,It works.  NO POST-SEASON games though.  Plus the added hassel factor of needing a cable subscription for any provider who does offer post-season games.  So  if you think that you can get away without having cable and get still to watch baseball  you will be sorely disappointed  when at the end of the regular season you are scrambling for a way to watch the world series.  I ended up purchasing a package just to watch the series... very disappointed.  I could have just bought what I ended up with and had a lot more options for viewing throughout the season  not just the mlb channel.  Live and learn.  If you only like baseball  well here you go.  You will end up at the smoky bar down the street to watch the post-season games.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999527216,2-Nov-22
PUBG MOBILE,Fun game! There are lots of different modes and guns and attachments and skins and.... You get it. There are just so many options and each battle is a different experience. This game also has what's called auto looting. Auto looting automatically picks up ammunition and guns off the floor so you don't have to check all the loot to find what you need the game does it four you. Now there is a microphone where you can hear players on your team talk (if they have it on) and there is no restrictions so they might say some bad things. I personally always mute my team mates and just use the quick chat option wich says things like  get in the car!  help! Or lets fall back! The game also has a play zone which shrinks as the game goes on and if you are outside of the play zone after a certain amount of time you will take damage. The maps are HUGE and sometimes if you can't find a car it can be frustrating because you can't get back to the play zone. And no adds!!! Big bonus.,POSITIVE,0,0.982996821,8-Apr-24

Additionally  there's a challenge with the availability of gems as they deplete quickly. I wish there was a more efficient and faster way to obtain them. The game is highly enjoyable  especially if you don't have the time for continuous play. However  if you prefer longer gaming sessions  this game may not be suitable for you.

Jackpot Magic - Casino Slots,Best slot for my style  but when they put me on a week long losing streak and only a couple spins as a VIP  it kinda sucks. Especially when my friend has more luck than I  so for that it hits the stars pretty hard. Plenty of freebies to keep you playing on the lower limit slots. Lots of great people on here. Customer service can be slow  but when you get help they stay on it. And with that being said  it stays at a firm 2 stars for a enjoyable time when you do win on the VIP slots.,POSITIVE,0,0.951406062,30-Oct-19
Jackpot Magic - Casino Slots,It takes waaaay too long to level up. It's painstakingly slow ð . Every time I get through another level (mostly because of a game I like)  I want to uninstall because it will take soooo long to unlock VIP areas  etc. Other than that  there is a good variety of games that keep me interested. If we're claiming all the prizes that YOU wrote into the app  please stop making us rejoin the table. Give us more time to be away  please. I enjoy this app for the most part. ð,POSITIVE,0,0.858101487,16-Mar-22

Jackpot Magic - Casino Slots,Update::::I'm updating my review and your rating lost a star   not because of game play  but because of ads for this game download on other platforms and apps. Your ads need work. They aren't properly coded and I have to exit out of games because they're constantly getting stuck. Now  if you can put together and maintain an app like JPMS  then I know you could fix this if you wanted to. Hands down the best slot game available! Love the themes  graphics and clubs feature!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.985662878,22-Jun-22
Jackpot Magic - Casino Slots,Needs major updating. Usual play this constantly  now most times I go on there's glitches. Becoming harder to keep coins and to get crowns for us who won't spend real money on the game. Slots keep over spinning. Keep getting network failure messages and now today all of a sudden the game kicks me out of the app completely. Needs more options for clubs to remove certain messages from chat as people can be nasty and leave rude messages and no option to delete single messages. Many changes needed.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999643207,14-Dec-23
Jackpot Magic - Casino Slots,I've got experience in over 50+ slot apps and this is by far the worst one I have ever played . Usually a slot app gives incentive for new players to help them progress to a good level before talking all their coins. On average I can reach level 40 to 50 before losing it all. This one  I got to 8. Which leaves me to believe the rtp is based at around 50% maybe lower. Out of my few hundred spins played I managed to get two bonuses with a 7x win and a 0x win. <-- that is terrible,NEGATIVE,1,0.999729455,28-Mar-20
Jackpot Magic - Casino Slots,Just deleted! Good game to waste time with  if you like slot games you might like this one. I played for a while before I got bored but it does get boring. There are better out there if you really enjoy slot games  but this does suffice to kill time. Final sentiments  not that fun and cost vs pay out  player will always lose faster!

Jackpot Magic - Casino Slots,it's good in the beginning but quickly becomes a game that pressures you to buy something. the game increasingly cheats as you level up.(you can see screen jump happening right before your eyes) I've had this game before on a different phone and this happened last time. If you don't mind spending money to level up then this is the game for you.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998438656,31-Mar-19
Jackpot Magic - Casino Slots,This game starts out great  let's you win  but then as you get in higher levels  it maybe 2-3 weeks before you get good spins before you start a winning streak again  they want you to buy coins. Waste of my time  used to be fun  love the club atmosphere but when you cant ever win to support the team  it's more frustrating then fun.,NEGATIVE,1,0.974077344,7-Dec-19
Jackpot Magic - Casino Slots,Can hardly win in this game and now cannot collect coins from watching the ads because the game crashes right after watching the ads. Daily spin bonus doesn't work because a game pop up to buy coins always comes up and causes the spin bonus to disappear when you click the X to close the pop up. Running the game on a new Pixel 7 Pro and I always keep my apps and games updated so this shouldn't be an issue on my end. Same issues happen with the other Big Fish Casino game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99951005,1-Jan-23
Jackpot Magic - Casino Slots,It's brutal. I'm on it currently. You can't win  free coins are far and few between. Most people who have trillions of coins  play on tables and squat  or play lowest bet. While some of us don't have alot of coins struggle because of them. It's not fun to be honest. It used to be very fair now its terrible. I'm looking for another app as this one is stressful. It's just not right. Everyone complains  most of us stay because we have made good friends. I would never recommend,NEGATIVE,1,0.998625278,2-Nov-22
Jackpot Magic - Casino Slots,I like this game. Wins are big and commonplace. There are loosing streaks  but they don't last. There are no annoying ads  which is a huge plus. Constant loading is a drag  but I got used to it. There could be a better variety of games  most are a lot alike. Love the clubs that offer choices of how you want to play.

Jackpot Magic - Casino Slots,I am a very long time player who has uninstalled this game several times I keep coming back hoping they changed back to what it used to be but alas.. The slots are unique  clever but you don't win like you use to  in fact you barely win at all. How can you play long when you don't win. This is a game!!! Don't tell me I have to know when to quit  it is not Las Vegas! I want to play more than 5 minutes a day because that is all it takes to lose my daily bonuses. Shame on you BF!!

Jackpot Magic - Casino Slots,This app use to be fun but has definitely become a rip off. All the new doors being introduced but you can't even win.

Jackpot Magic - Casino Slots,I'm convinced most accounts are bot players . Billionaire squatters EVERYWHERE! You don't win on this site period. I've been playing for years  and there's no chance of winning. I only purchased once  and they instantly took my free videos away so I couldn't get free coins.

Jackpot Magic - Casino Slots,social features are great  clubs are good but be careful who you join they will take your funding and boot you out. I'd advise people to spin low to build up coins I've noticed the higher you bet the odds get less and less sends you broke very fast. I certainly wouldn't recommend buying chips I've brought in the past and lose it fast I've stopped buying because you never win.

Jackpot Magic - Casino Slots,I absolutely use to love this game until I recently kept being ejected from the table during a huge win. This happened often lately especially while I was paying actual money to purchase coins. I think nothing of it knowing I could write them and most likely have the coins credited to my account. Lmao! No such luck! First they want screenshots of the issues so I send them in and then they want the EXACT time and date of the issues happening.

Jackpot Magic - Casino Slots,Can't purchase! I have tried contacting them and tried five different credit cards that all have money on them and it keeps giving me an error message and no one has gotten back to me which is absolutely ridiculous and it's not on Verizon's and because I sat there and troubleshooted with them for almost an hour and bought from a different app without a problem so it's their app that's the problem and no one will get back to me.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998689353,26-Oct-19
Jackpot Magic - Casino Slots,Not only would they not refund even part of a large accidental purchase (leaned onto my phone to clean up a spill and accidentally tapped buy)  I never even heard back from my desperate plea to customer service.

Jackpot Magic - Casino Slots,Frustrating!! The  glitches  in the program have taken alot of the fun out of the game for me. I have self paid a couple thousand dollars in just a couple months  building up my competitive team. As leader of the club  i feel that these constant  glitches  are not a issue with the program  but deliberate. I have had everything from free spins disappear after a win during the free spins in a max bet  1.3 billion be subtracted indtead of a win and much more  costing me billions. What do i do.

Jackpot Magic - Casino Slots,You'll have better luck in Vegas! Don't waste real money on buying chips because the slots are VERY tight with low payouts. The challenges are designed so you have to spend real money to complete them and the rewards aren't worth it. There are other slot games out there where you can play longer without using real money. I still play but I no longer spend any real money and only get about 5 minutes before my chips are gone. It could be so much better.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998984873,29-Sep-22

Big Fish Casino - Slots Games,If you're looking for a fair game that has actual odds that you can beat  DON'T pick this game. It's completely rigged. They've made it basically impossible to win at anything the game controls (craps  blackjack  slots) to force people to pay to continue playing. If a slot machine has 5 rows and the first 3 have set you up for a jackpot or minigame  the last 2 rows will purposefully spin past the tiles you need. Seen it on many  MANY occasions.

Big Fish Casino - Slots Games,I've had this game for 10+ years playing here and there. It used to be fun and you would get a lot of wins that allowed for you to play longer. Now  there is no winning  they even took away the ability to watch an ad to give you extra funds. I looked forward to those extra 5 ads so I could play a little every day. Now I've spent lots $ and still lose everything within a short time frame. It's nice to play if you have tons of extra $$$ to invest in it.

Big Fish Casino - Slots Games,Sept 2020 update - I had a year off and logged on and nothing has changed. You can't play without purchasing coins and the slots are so tight  it's not worth it. I'm amazed BF still have regular players. Fun game with good graphics but payouts are far too few and far between. It is impossible to level up after a while and even a so called big win  is never more than 3.5 times the original bet.

You'll have maybe one big win a year  then go broke  then have to wait for your free chips  then go broke  then wait then on and on. It's extremely frustrating.

It's definitely different than any of the other 25 or so I've checked out & deleted after the promo coins are gone. I was able to play this one for over an hour  with some left over for later (min. bets) but it didn't seem to add level up rewards as I was playing.

I've playing since before bigfish was owned by Churchill Downs and when Classic Slots were available but sadly this app has changed hands a few times since has declined to the point there are rarely a full table anywhere.

Big Fish Casino - Slots Games,Big fish needs to change several things on this app that have gotten worse with past updates. The menu and chat buttons are now in the middle of the screen; very much in the way. You cannot see what some of your opponents have in their pots  and what the dealer has in black jack. You also cannot see who has given you gifts  nor can you look at other players' information screens. It is just a black screen without any information.

If I receive the 9.8 billion I will delete this review sorry it had to come to this.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999523282,3-Dec-23
Big Fish Casino - Slots Games,I love several of the slots. However  you can never win enough chips to play longer than a few minutes. Also  I like to talk to the other players now and then via the game's chat feature. It's fun to cheer each other on  or moan about constant losing (that helps). But if I do chat  and am not fast enough  Big Fish boots me outta the game room I'm in. That bites! It's not like I type slow either  or am a squatter (I'm not). Some slots pay out more than others and a few NEVER pay out.,NEGATIVE,1,0.978314757,15-Apr-20
Big Fish Casino - Slots Games,It's not fun anymore! Big fish has control of all the games as in they boot you from the game if you're winning. The reels stick and jump. It's impossible do win any if the jackpots because they've got it so tight it's just not fun. The only reason I stay us because if the friendships I've made throughout the years while playing this game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999655485,25-Aug-20
Big Fish Casino - Slots Games,This app lags A LOT on android & has been crashing constantly. I have tried re-installing app as suggested & now it's taking forever to install (only happens w/ BFC app) other apps / games load fine. After several attempts in re-installing this app  I have been unsuccessful..not cool! On my laptop /windows app is fine w/ loading but I do get put into many empty rooms in shared games like wicked wins  mouse  etc. How fun lol?

Big Fish Casino - Slots Games,The most horrible pays outs I've ever seen on a FREE casino I've got two accounts and used to spend a lot of money on each accounts and you never win hardly anything back just spend then lose them then a pop up to buy more I've stopped buying and play with what I get daily so I play less then a minute each morning then lose the few coins I get daily what a worthless game.will never spend anything on this game again.update..deleting this game for a bit don't think it will get any better.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999678254,7-Sep-21
Big Fish Casino - Slots Games,I have both Big Fish Casino and Jackpot Magic Slots on my phone. I went to collect my coins that were available to me....had to  x-out  of eight  yes 8 of your pop-up ad's wanting me to purchase more coins from you. Your money grubby game is getting as bad as Facebook with all the pop-up ad's that we have to get past in order to play the game. I'm almost to the point of just deleting the game and finding something more user friendly. Also  the Big Fish Solitaire Blast game is broken as well.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999736488,21-Oct-22
Big Fish Casino - Slots Games,Game has gone down hill drastically in the last 6 months or so. problems with ads freezing the game  and now not giving you chips for watching advertisments or earnrd in other awards. Support is of no help trying to say it's on the users end due to settings. yet this has started happening on all three of my android devises all set up differently other than the fact they all have been upgraded to the most recent BF app. Clearly a problem within their own software. Also slots are WAY to tight now,NEGATIVE,1,0.999418616,2-Jul-22
Big Fish Casino - Slots Games,Useto be one of my favorite games because it was just like the casino. Well it is just like the casino I can never get a win there either. You would think with over 2000k coins betting at 50k I would get one good win but never got more than my bet back. Coins just drain out then they expect you to buy more. Why? So I can not get a win with those either? I've played for about 6 months I think I've won good one time. Not worth downloading,NEGATIVE,1,0.999354184,27-Oct-23
Big Fish Casino - Slots Games,If you're looking for a slot game that always blocks the menu with in-game  deals   an increasingly toxic community if you don't bet high  a large library of reskinned duplicates  and a tournament system rich with either bots or cheaters  this is the game for you! I've been playing for years and this game has gone so far downhill it isn't even funny. Can't recommend to anyone.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999810159,6-Jul-20
Big Fish Casino - Slots Games,When you first start playing you'll win a lot but then higher your level the less likely to win big pots!

Big Fish Casino - Slots Games,This game should come with a warning stating that it can cause depression many honest people who play it would agree.Games are good but as soon as you get a big jp or anything like it  it's taken right back from you before you get anymore decent win. There are now a lot of bfc hate groups out there. Think before downloading,NEGATIVE,1,0.976975739,5-Apr-24
Big Fish Casino - Slots Games,I uninstalled this when Burn 3 was removed.I reinstalled it several months later  a couple of weeks ago actually and I was happy to see Burn3 returned. Only to have it be gone again the last several times I have wanted to play. So I have now uninstalled it again and wonder  why? Why is there a problem keeping this game active?

Big Fish Casino - Slots Games,The worst of all casino apps. The worst bonuses. The worst payouts. The worst statistics for win percentage. The worst realism. You have better odds of being hit by a bus. Support sucks. Incompetent leadership. 37 separate emails have been sent with technical issues  statistics on poor wins and data on their games. Thanks for the two whole spins very generous of you. I provided them with pictures and they never acknowledged their trickery  poor programming ZERO STARS ðð¼ðð¼,NEGATIVE,1,0.999681711,9-Sep-23
Big Fish Casino - Slots Games,So this game used to be one of the best casino games around. Not anymore  they've become so money hungry it's now more of a  you've got to pay to play . Not worth it. I was dumb enough to try and let me tell you  $50 gave me a whole 10 min. of game time. Sure there's competitions and teams so you get prizes  but they don't want to give up the prizes. So all you can do is log in everyday and collect bonuses. Let it build for a week and you can play 5 minutes.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998209,16-Jul-20

Big Fish Casino - Slots Games,Same as others I played a few years back but deleted as the lack of wins became shocking. Recently downloaded again hoping for some improvement but unfortunately not.

GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,A brilliant and generous gacha game.The story is immaculate and makes me want more. The character designs are beautiful  and characters are filled with  personality  and depth. Any issues are fixed quickly  and I personally have not faced any. I've been playing since a little before nier collab  enjoyed every second of it  and never regretted anything.,POSITIVE,0,0.999777377,23-Dec-23
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,If you're going to play some free-to-play mobile trash  it might as well be this game. In all seriousness  it has one of the better level up / growth systems compared to other FTP games. High quality visuals and animation paired with one of the best sound tracks that has zero right being in a mobile game. Main story can actually hold your attention if you take the time follow along.,POSITIVE,0,0.651563108,11-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,NIKKE overall is amazing  good plot and story  great character designs  amazing soundtracks and more. To those who think this is your run-of-the-mill coomer gacha game  playing this might change your mind. I do have a few complaints: Firstly  soundtracks tend to break when transitioning to loading screens  which returns to normal after a bit but I find it annoying from time to time. Secondly  the game crashes after playing the game for maybe 2 hours  which i find very inconvenient,NEGATIVE,1,0.997947276,25-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,The game has improved a lot  only thing that bugs me is the size of everything when it goes on landscape mode  you can barely read any text unless you get like 1 inch close to your screen. I would love it if the buttons/text would adjust to landscape mode by being big enough to where you can easily see  tap and read them without any issue. Small buttons are hard to tap during landscape mode too.,POSITIVE,0,0.681568325,24-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,NIKKE as a game is great. However  what makes me have it rated at 2* is because of an ongoing issue i've been having with this game for most of the majority of my time playing that has really gotten on my nerves. And that is the fact that entering the Cash Shop for the most part  is nearly impossible to do without the game crapping itself and it repeatedly continuing to refuse because of a  network error  regardless that the connection to even remotely play the game is completely fine. :/,NEGATIVE,1,0.529341042,26-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,This game is great with the story of characters and the models is great. My problem is that it requires me to invest more time in the game and its heavy on the device. It pushed to uninstall the game  only coming back to see what i missed. update: might have to uninstall soon  its getting heavier and i just realized that the rewards aren't that rewarding for me,NEGATIVE,1,0.997157574,11-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,Tried playing again. Still no optimizations nearly 6 months later. Arena battles  even with quick battle  take forever. You STILL can't switch to another app to check something without the game crashing and starting the horribly long login sequence all over  it's ridiculous. Great game but absolutely 0 care given to performance. Plus they don't really bother to slim down file sizes  huge updates everytime... for 2d images..,NEGATIVE,1,0.912493467,26-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,I've been playing this since it was still in beta  and it's been awesome to see it grow since then. I love how you can decide how much you want to get involved in the gameplay  and it doesn't affect how much the storyline sucks you in. The Nikkes are on point as well  being almost collectable and endlessly upgradeable  and the limited collaborations make them just that much more sought after. Plus  they're frickin HOT! ð¥µ Can't wait to see where this goes  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,POSITIVE,0,0.998776972,25-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,The game's extremely enjoyable  there's so much content and no stamina system to exhaust and stop you from playing. Even when hitting a wall  you can borrow strong units to continue progressing. I love all the different characters  the animated cutscenes and it's got some great OST too. My only gripe is the music usually breaking during loading screens and a few times the game crashed in the middle of a battle. Other than that it's great. The story is also interesting. Highly recommended game.,POSITIVE,0,0.999467075,9-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,The game is good  the characters as well  your gatcha system is normal  nothing different from others in my opinion  i like the game and i'm willing to keep playing it  just one thing and this a very personal opinion  i really hate Syuen  what frustrating character. Then again  i like the game and i'll keep playing for sure.,POSITIVE,0,0.990673363,26-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,The game is very good  nice story  characters  voice acting  etc. But the latest update makes it harder for me to enjoy. The problem being download resources error  it is always stuck at 0 or 9 even though my internet connection works perfectly fine  after and hour or so it's still stuck and it really kills my enjoyment on the game. I even tried deleting and re-downloading the app but it still the same. For now  I'll keep my rating to one until the problem is fixed :( Edit: Problem fixed thx :),NEGATIVE,1,0.999672174,5-Feb-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,This game has gotten better over time. There are ways to get more currency reliably now and every event basically comes with two free 10x pulls. The game has great art and the writing is decent. Although the game really does need more actual gameplay. The boss battles are the funnest thing in the game so they repeat a lot of them but it's a pity that fun isn't replicated in other modes. Overall worth a try.,POSITIVE,0,0.997509122,5-Feb-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,This game has been very fun for the amount I have played  but there are some things that do bother me a little. The way to level up Nikkes is a little bothersome. Only does a good abundance of lvl materials come from the story  and even then  the difficulty could stop them from gaining those materials  so honestly  I suggest adding a way to properly gain them. Also  having much more to do besides just power level to finish the story after a few days the feel to log in a play gets a little boring,NEGATIVE,1,0.997947991,12-Feb-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,Overalls the game is very good and enjoyable. Hope developer improve their game in landscape mode in mobile device. The UI and combat very small in landscape mode and make me uncomfortable. I do hope for the story or event story can fully maximize in landscape mode. I do enjoy the story. In Portrait mode the only issues is an icon tab at the lobby are too closed from each other.,POSITIVE,0,0.999245882,9-Feb-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,I really enjoy this game's... Er... Writing. That being said  I'm currently experiencing a few bugs that have been negatively affecting my experience: for whatever reason  the videos that typically play on the recruit menu for both the special and ordinary banners have not been playing at all recently. All I get is a black screen. While it definitely doesn't take much away from the experience  it does make me feel as if I'm missing out on an experience that most other players are getting.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994856834,20-Mar-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,This game is great before 6 months. Eventually  it just gets boring. The gameplay is fun but gets incredibly repetative(even after a year). The lore is actually pretty interesting but is completely butched by how stupid the commander and some nikkes are. The art  writing  and voice acting are great. However  there are some inconsistencies. Music is a mixed bag. There are some nikkes that have a really interesting backstory  but most of them land flat. The game is also incredibly easy.,NEGATIVE,1,0.984508038,20-Mar-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,The game is overall great. Characters have nice designs  and *most* of their backstories are interesting  fun  and humorous. The main story is intriguing  which made me continue playing this game. Events are fun and interesting too  especially the CO-OP events  which are super fun! But unfortunately  when I enter a boss fight  which is an event or the interception  my game crashes either immediately after entering the game or after a couple of seconds of being in the battle. I'm using RedMagic 9,POSITIVE,0,0.987538695,23-Mar-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,The story  gameplay and team building are fun. Music is great. English VAs are good for the most part and i never use English dubs. Getting to end game is tedious and leveling up characters and skills is slow. The price of real money to speed up the process is unbsurdly high and unjustifiable. If you decide to play this game  take it slow and work your way through; the end game is worth it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.616452217,25-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,The game is great from soundtracks  graphics  story depth and personality of each Nikke. The flaw lies on the game itself  often times the sound breaks for some reason and is observed over multiple device I use. And the loading of each and every screen  fights and scenes needs to be optimized and shouldn't take 8-15 seconds to load. Given that I experience this both on PC and Mobile.,NEGATIVE,1,0.512938261,23-Feb-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,Love the game everything is good graphics characters design stories etc... but there one thing i faced is that on mobile devices while i use the landscape mode it's UI is not optimize at all the text is so small and its to difficult to read and icons are so small too i appreciate that they added landscape mode but it's not optimize at all other than that everything is good except the landscape mode it need some optimization i hope the developer team will work on this issues thank you,NEGATIVE,1,0.991485417,28-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,Very good game  and attention catching characters! There's only one problem though  this game makes my phone super laggy  my fps dropped to 0 sometimes and it's so unplayable. I still keep this game with me because the characters are just straight out pretty  and good story line too! But the lag stopped my characters farming.,NEGATIVE,1,0.921221077,11-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,The developers of this game have done a great job of listening to what the fans want  and have been improving the game since it's release. However  the boss mechanics are still some of the most frustrating and over tuned challenges I've encountered in my time playing games. There is a lot to enjoy if you just want cute and sexy characters  and a decent story  but stay far away if you want well balanced and fair encounter design.,POSITIVE,0,0.995337844,7-Feb-24

GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,Having so much fun  no stamina system while proceeding the story  difficulty spikes were balanced  voice acting is good  graphics qualities ia good  story is good  drop rates also good  my drawback is the R grade units is useless  if only we can make R grade can be close to SR grade in terms of power  it will be perfect.

GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,Before this review  I wanted to give the game a 5/5  but I was having frequent crashes on my S24 Ultra that made the game unplayable at times. That  however  does not seem to be the case after this new update. I will now update my rating to reflect how I feel about the game at its current form  that being a 5/5.

GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,One of my favorite mobile games right now. The story and characters is what truly deserves all the glory. The devs keep adding stories or fun events which keeps the game from getting boring. And on top of that the music is on another level and the characters are fully voiced. The only problem I have is that the gameplay can feel repetitive after a while and the loading times. I've been playing this game since release and I'm still enjoying it over a year later. Amazing game,POSITIVE,0,0.996117711,21-Mar-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,The initial download too excruciatingly long despite me not downloading the large pack and the fact that I have an optic fiber connection. When I did finally manage to finish the first thing I noticed was the difference in the animation of breasts vs mouth. There was a lot of care in the former and absolutely none in the latter. That was my first indication that this is basically a harem collection game. The rest of the gameplay did not grab me at all as the focus again was on the animation.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998557985,24-Mar-24

The events and characters are wonderful  but when you realise you get stuck at lvl 160 with tons of characters that should be capable  But wait you have 1 thats 3 star  It can be lvl 200.

GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,its a good game. the gunplay demands accuracy as there are key weak spots on the enemies along with type advantage. each class of gun works different and the game encourages you to mix it up with your team instead of just brute forcing through the game. gacha rate is ok  but that will be questioned through each pull for the coming future,POSITIVE,0,0.996467948,25-Apr-24

GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,I just got the new Samsung S24 Ultra  and this game continues to crash repeatedly. I had hoped with this new update this issue would be fixed  but I'm still having issues.

GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,Entertaining and can make decent progress without money. Core story is interesting  but once you get into it the characters added later really stand out due to not fitting the world setting. Edit. It's been several months and I'm still enjoying the game.

GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,Pretty fun game  I really enjoy the story and of course the beautiful women  HOWEVER this game is getting a 1 star from me until they fix the constant crashing that's happening on S24U phones. $1500 flagship device that is the pinnacle of mobile phones but Nikke can't run on it?

GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,The game is interesting. It has many mechanics. The basics is easy to understand. It is quite generous in giving currency to gamble in the gacha for new characters as a beginner. Main issue is the crashes. Hopefully with the next update  the system will adapt to the new generation phones.,POSITIVE,0,0.998436749,27-Mar-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,The story is really enjoyable. The main story is fully voiced. The story isn't anything new  but how they presentate it with the voice actors is what makes it really enjoyable. I managed to get all the jokes in it. Update 25 Apr 24: The game has improved a lot. No bugs that annoys me anymore. Been playing on PC since the client came out there. Also have it on phone just so that I could buy the items with google play. Also the game is extremely generous. Unlike Gens--*cough*. Thanks  ShiftUp.,POSITIVE,0,0.999702513,25-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,I cannot even get through my daily activities without the game crashing multiple times. On a S24 ultra. My wifi connection is stable  and I have tried changing the graphics settings to every combination possible. Doesn't make a difference. This is one of my favorite games  so it is really disappointing. This never happened on my S23 ultra or on PC. I will update this review when the game stops crashing.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998669267,21-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,I really enjoy playing the game  but it has been crashing like crazy on my samsung galaxy s24 and now I can't play the game as much as I would like to. I'm lowering my rating it keeps crashing on my samsung galaxy s24 and I can't enjoy playing the game if it keeps kicking me out every minute also lowering graphics doesn't help it still crashes.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997805536,27-Mar-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,Character design is fantastic  and the gameplay is actually very and I mean VERY enjoyable. I didnt expect the story to be good at all at first  it's actually very intriguing and entertaining. The game is also very generous for the gacha system and gives A LOT of free pulls. 10/10 :) but I wish you could oath the characters like azur lane.,POSITIVE,0,0.999766529,26-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,SEA Server unstable network  both on wifi and mobile data  regardless of internet speed  the server buffers almost everytime I do something  system error occurs here and there. The game is really good  its just that this connection problem ruins the game experience.,NEGATIVE,1,0.986464381,26-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,the game is absolutely fun to play especially with all these wifu the only problem is I wish they made a little bit easier to do pulls to get new characters and when it gets to chapter 4 it start getting hell hard leveling up all my characters in my squad is still not enough and getting items to level up your character is also hard to get if they made that a little bit easier this game will be a five star for me,POSITIVE,0,0.828193724,11-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,Bored. I tried to play this game  but it was so monsterously boring. A man cannot survive on waifus alone. It wouldn't let me play with a controller either; it wanted me to rub my fingers all over the screen  specifically where the girls butts are  to aim. It feels like there's something like a game here  but it's buried under having to constantly touch and tap everything to do anything. It's also a base builder. I hate base builders.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999117076,27-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,Am not a fan of gatcha game  but this one is unique and very generous with the poll. The game it's not to breeding with your time and the game himself is super fun. Am always back to listen the music and read the story with for me is sometime hit or miss. Right now I really enjoy the story and all the characters design. I just wish I could get some character and costume that I miss.,POSITIVE,0,0.999705851,25-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,So I used to rate this game highly but as soon as I see the writing on the wall  I jump ship and I have jumped ship. The re zero event I rolled 110 draws. 70 on rem and 30 on Emilia. I got rem once and Emilia zero times. The drop rates are absolutely mitigated and it's just not something I will support. It was a fun game but it's become far too greedy. I've moved on and just gone back to better games. Don't waste your time or effort; please. Find less predatory games. There are far better games.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999357641,18-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,The core gameplay is fun  the music is great  the butt is shake  overall it's enjoyable but there are some glaring problems. Numerous gameplay bugs  to the point it's more rare to find a character whose skills AREN'T bugged than one that is. Luckily the devs have responded quite fast to a power adjustment and we did receive some bug fixes  so they do seem to be receptive to feedback. I can recommend NIKKE for those who are patient enough to deal with the bugs  so here's hoping for the best.,POSITIVE,0,0.994543552,24-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,I have played this game every day since the start of September  so about 7 months now. I enjoy Nikke a lot and I won't be stopping any time soon! The stories and writing are really good  despite a few small English typos. The VAs are done well and there are many various personalities amongst the Nikkes as well. As far as I can see  it's not P2W unless you're doing PvP Arena. I've also never had any crashes or other technical issues - it plays flawlessly. Thank you for your hard work  Shift Up!,POSITIVE,0,0.999809682,11-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,It's better than what FGO devs could produce. Except for the leveling system  unless you pull out your credit card  you're going to reach a dead end in the story chapters where you eventually just can't do anything since you're so underpowered. So you either have to play more and more to get more Nikkes and max limit  break them  or not play the game at all.,NEGATIVE,1,0.9933061,28-Apr-24
GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE,Five stars  but lately it has been crashing a lot the screen freezes and its very annoying specially when clearing campaign stages and interception  i have to re start the game and it doesn't register that the stage is cleared  pls fix it its been like this since some versions ago,NEGATIVE,1,0.999596775,25-Apr-24
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Game has become boring. Same events  no nee challenges. Inventory filled with items that no events have not been done for years. No progression but Stat level.

Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Addictive great times with friends. Why does my app now crash all the time. I have played since the beginning of the game. I have reinstalled numerous times. Any help on what might be causing this? Please fix opening steel RSS too!ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.943032086,7-Apr-24
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Update March 2024. The app still keeps crashing after prior updates. I can't even use the application. Its all about pay for play. spend time to buy special boosts then that equipment becomes obsolete. Frequent updates usually cause problems. quality control is an afterthought. Update 01/2021: they made a mistake and overcorrected by taking items out of players inventories. Items like Victory Badges needed to grow are increasingly hard to find.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999742568,1-Mar-24
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,The game crashes too much. I do not understand why. I have kept up with the updates as well as clearing the cache. The game is still crashing. I cleared the data also. It still crashes when I try to open.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999532342,16-Mar-24
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Played for years  I am supposed to get expedited service  I have not been able to play since the Feb 27th update  4 requests for help  no response in weeks  clearly they do not care.

Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Customer Support link in game is down when you click Support building on your base. Goes to blank screen and Moderator in game chat is non existent. I messaged Moderator about problems in game and he or she never responded. I got on Google Play Store and clicked Support link here and sent email to Fun Plus Games about Support in game being down and know what they said? It's not our problem  his is in game problem and you have to contact the in game Support team and tell them. It's impossible.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999451697,8-Apr-24

Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,This game is very expensive. Upgrades take too much to enhance and soon as you do they drop something new on the players. Played this game for years and it just seems that the developer is more concerned about making money than fixing problems. Parts of the game says coming soon and it been over 3 years and it hasn't came yet. Nothing new is added to the game except gear and other things they want you to purchase. The game is dying but they don't care. Most regions are dead.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999676704,14-Jan-24
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,The game used to be fun but this invisible HQ glitch is killing the game more now. They kill lower-level threats and then teleport to them the moment they kill it. After a few minutes  they disappear. These invisible players attack knowing they can't get attacked in return. They also can hide their alliance buildings the same way they hide their HQs. Not cool. Plus  the updates they claim fix the issues never fixes it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999296427,13-Dec-23
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Great app when it's works. Have not been able to get on in almost 2 days. I'm losing resources because I'm not able to get on.It keeps saying  not able to connect. This happens way too often. Wish they would fix it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998588741,20-Jan-24
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Very interesting great Game with allot of very good and Interesting features that I could unlock by Completing Level and it also has allot of Challenges that I could unlock by Completing Level to Try and it more wonderful than I Could ever Imagine Elsewhere in My Current Human Life even though Your not interested in War Game You Should Give it a Try it a very great Game to Play,POSITIVE,0,0.999838948,26-Jan-24
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,The game itself was fun  but then my account was banned because the game itself was glitching. My buildings would lose level and then I wouldn't be able to make troops or whatever. Then when I click on contact us  it crashes and restarts itself again for the same loop. It'd be great to have my account unlocked. The abnormal activity was your game glitching. Not me cheating....that would just be pointless.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998578429,1-Dec-18
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,I have played this game for 8 months now. To date it has been okay  but just okay. It is easy to develop some good online friends for the social aspect  but as far as the game goes  and the support from developers - it is very BAD. It is very easy to level up quickly  however  as soon as you reach a certain level you basically have to spend hundreds of pounds/dollars to level up miore  or be left behind picking up very little rewards that the game gives - to push you into purchasing more assets.The Triumph Passes that enable you to grow quickly are also VERY BAD and unbalanced. E.g. An alliance member will get 3 x equipment upgrades (worth alot in the game)  whilst other get nothing but rubbish - of absolute no value. This is not balanced as the players pay the same money. If you want to complain about anything  don't waste your time  the developers only care about money - nothing else - and the GREED is off the scale. Don't waste your time on this game for long term play - it is a waste of time.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997114658,28-May-20
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Most recent update will not allow the game to continue beyond the splash screen ad for a 1st time buyers special.  Otherwise the game is typical for the strategy MMO's.  Even when functioning it's a bit buggy during times of high activity outside of your base (for instance the blitzkrieg event).  When this happens the game just locks up and had to be restarted to continue. UPDATE: Game has to be uninstalled and then reinstalled to fix the issue caused by the most recent update.  This game has too many coding issues to recommend .,NEGATIVE,1,0.99967289,31-Jul-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,I played for about 8 months  it was a fun but repetitive game. Gather resources  upgrade buildings  and wait a day  week  month for upgrade to complete. Like all things the novelty erodes and you see a P2W strategy that if you are upgrading without spending a dime it is difficult but not impossible. If you want this to be a true MMO  where is the PVE area? Some don't enjoy PVP  just an idea PROS: they did give you alot more loot & protection items that other basebuilders out there. CONS: dramatic players  P2W  very repetitive for higher levels,NEGATIVE,1,0.995595634,4-Jun-20
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,I saw an ad with naval ships fighting in an arctic sea and thought it looked awesome ... I don't see that anywhere in the game at all. No sea  no arctic  no ships  ... like ... at all. I saw lines of soldiers firing on each other in an ad for Guns and Glory ... and found instead a game that was identical to this one with simply a different theme (but identical game) ... and no lines of soldiers firing on each other. Wth? I can also see that this is going to advance quickly into a pay-to-win game. It's fun  sure  but I can see it's going to hit a  pay or uninstall  wall soon after level 5.,POSITIVE,0,0.966084599,7-Oct-18
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Some of the interface is hard to interact with. There are soooo many little menus. There are a few buttons that are so small you have to just jab your finger repeatedlymoving at only slightly to the left right up and down until the button actually. Also there needs to be a free way to shield your base from attack. If you are away from your base for any length of time you'll get attacked and there's nothing you can do about it unless you pay the money to put up a piece shield around your base.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99948597,24-Sep-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Like the real time multiplayer aspect of this game but your enjoyment of it is really dependant on having an active alliance otherwise it's a solitary and disheartening experience (on account of getting raided all the time). Wish the text was bigger and that the instructions and redirects were better. However  game wont connect to network after the scheduled maintenance. Continuously checking to see if its working is frustrating  wont keep trying unless issue is resolved soon,NEGATIVE,1,0.978764176,25-Nov-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,I have not played this app for over 3 months but since then the app has improved. The only problem I am still having is when out in the field searching for resources  the app will take continuous short interruptions or pause when trying to move fast in the direction that has been chosen. It really gets irritable after some time moving at a slow pace looking for resources and when you get to a resource to occupy it  white arrows appear from another player placing claim because of interruptions.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997904539,4-Sep-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,The game has some really cool ideas  the focus on alliances and politics within each region is really cool and I met alot of really cool people. Ultimately though the gameplay is repetitive and dull the base building aspects (and all other gameplay aspects really) funnel you along to paywalls. The whole game is set up to get the whales to the top and keep them there. It's malicious monetization in the worst sense of the phrase  using people's bonds to squeeze money out of them. Super depressing.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995204329,23-Sep-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,The game has improved quite a bit since v1  however  still not advisable to bother with the pay to win aspect  no matter how much you pay  you'll still be mauled  no matter how much you spend. It's quite impossible to progress in reasonable time though without spending regularly but regardless how much you spend you'll be catching up with others how spend more or receive more freebies (to get to lv40 and have all the cool equipment you'll need to spend several $/â¬100),POSITIVE,0,0.88839817,17-Jul-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,I quite like this game. but it is very frustrating when players don't follow the rules of the regions. And it would be really helpful if the developers could develop a strategy guide so that new players knew what on earth was going on - even for the advanced players this is a challenge. My major bug is that  although i accept the game runs 24/7/365  it would be nice if the Peace Shields were considerably cheaper in terms of the in-game Gold cost. A second bugbear is that the cost of building  troops and research on the higher levels means that you are waiting for d-a-y-s to take the next step  unless  of course  you pay for speedups and powerups. It does seem to me that this is very much a pay-to-win game  at least on the higher levels  and I agree with some of the commentators who say that if you haven't got a deep Credit Card you cannot effectively play the game; I suspect that many players except those who are seriously cash-committed will leave the game eventually.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998596489,21-Jan-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Too much clutter on the screen plus your not able to zoom out to see your full base. Instructions are vague and I feel like a sheep following there finger pressing buttons not knowing what it does. Plus the kicker......I still don't know how to donate to the alliance  I see the button but completely confused next steps. I'll try a bit longer but will probably uninstall game in a week or so. Zoom out/in is a must for me. One more thing I have to agree with most of the complaints and say this is a chic magnet catch with tons of in game purchases. ð¤,NEGATIVE,1,0.99823606,30-Sep-18
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,This game plays nothing like the ad. Which really tricked me  as the ad looked like actual gameplay (unlike those ads with over the top cgi). I can't stand these clickbait games  with lots of flashy icons and the illusion of progress without really achieving anything. Clearly there must be a market for them  but I hate how they pretend to look like strategy games when really they are quite limited.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999260604,1-Jan-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Meh  it's alright for an idle type game  you can advance pretty quickly though if you actively play. It's got a slow start  and a confusing menu system  but  once you get the hang of it it gets pretty streamlined. All in all  it's a good game to play if you need to kill a bunch of time  and you can play the game without spending a cent  granted they shove pay to advance stuff in your face constantly  it's not necessary to do so  the main game can be played without caving in to save time.,POSITIVE,0,0.998311162,3-Aug-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Very addictive and fun. Great variety of events and things to do in game. However  game is completely ruined by just a few players who spend insane amounts of money to be the biggest players. They form groups who just teleport around the map and attack everyone else. Expect to be completely destroyed every few days no matter what you do and then spend the rest of your time and resources to rebuild only to be destroyed again once you've rebuilt.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998342991,27-Sep-18
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,One of the best games I have ever had the privilege of playing. Good tactics and alliance interaction and many rewards. Nice interface  loads quickly  great graphics and smooth gameplay. Definitely worth downloading  will be sticking to this for a long time to come. Interaction with players world wide. Good built-in translation to boot. Thanks to the creators  job well done.,POSITIVE,0,0.999798357,29-Nov-18
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,The games math is wrong with % and children should not play the game. The developer gives options of deception and cruel confusing game play. Need to change age requirements for adults+18 or most weak minded people should not play at all!,NEGATIVE,1,0.998651564,9-Feb-24
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,I've played this game 4 times always great but this time even after deleting it 3 ti mes scream still freezes up all time can't do anything fix it please,NEGATIVE,1,0.992387414,5-Feb-24
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,The last month the game has moved at a snail's pace  movement on the screen is so horribly slow  I don't even want to play anymore  none of my other games show the same slowness  so it's got to be this game! Even moving the tabs to use coins in the exchanges takes forever. Opening crates for the daily rewards is a pure nightmare anymore  something needs to change!,NEGATIVE,1,0.99975878,27-Feb-20
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Awesome strategic/political game  very playable and intuitive mechanics. May be a bit complex for 1st time players  but the layers peel away quickly  if you find yourself an experienced and compatible Alliance. Completely playable as a free game as long as you can exercise patience and discipline. Reading and watching as many tutorials as you can  is of definite  long term benefit  to your gameplay experience.,POSITIVE,0,0.999161005,27-Dec-18
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Word is that this game gives China a bigger discount than America. I had a couple Chinese dudes tell me this as i played this game. I dont like the fact that the equipment and anything else you need for upgrades are so damn expensive!!! To teleport without a teleport is 2000 gold!!! Gold aint free  this game sucks big time.. another thing is when you start to upgrade to a higher level base it will require more packs to complete any and all upgrades. I estimate over 10grand if your a top dog,NEGATIVE,1,0.996791303,14-Nov-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,I'm not real interested in continuing this game. I don't like the shielding options. All I can get is 8hr shields  and I have one 24 hour shield  and their cost is astrinomical. I need 3day or 7day shields  like Stellar Age has  to be able to keep up with a game. I can't be looking over my shoulder multiple times a day. I will update my review if this changes because I do like a lot about this game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.985040188,19-Oct-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,So I have this game on multiple devices for things and each time I play there's a new update. From experience  updates don't always mean for the best. My number one complaint is the God damn pointy fingers and arrows zooming to things and won't stop until I've clicked. Ffs. Just let me play the game. It's so distracting and unnecessary. There needs to be an option to switch it off. I don't care about the other glitches if that was gone. also where have missions gone?,NEGATIVE,1,0.999129951,6-Sep-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Installed this game once. Put about 4 to 5 hundred dollars in it over a year. Phone died. Changed back to an older phone. Couldn't get access to my account again. I had a level 24 base with good about medium fighting power and had to start ALL STINKIN OVER again. I emailed the developers since 4 times. Nothing is resolved after 1 month. There are some really great people playing this game as well. I wanted to stay in touch with them. This is the only thing that keeps me playing.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999300003,12-Jan-20
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Horrible  game  that only begs for your money to let you play. If you try to not use real money to progress  you might have to wait up to 60 hours real time to build/upgrade stuff. Also  there's hand-holding all the time  and you need to follow a hardcoded progress ladder that leave little to no freedom. I'm uninstalling this one as well. Just like all the other  free to play   games .,NEGATIVE,1,0.999291897,14-Dec-18
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Quality Time Waster. Overall battle play is boring. Constant barrage of money grabbing offers that are nearly required to get by or compete. Game is battery draining. Numerous bugs unfixed. Game support is an automated system set to 'Ignore all Messages'. It's a game you keep playing hoping it gets better  but it doesn't. Save yourself some time and disk space. Do not install.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999769866,12-Nov-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,I think this is a great game and fun past time to play. The set back to it is really unfair and unjust to the smaller Alliances. The smaller Alliances are constantly under attack!!! Which leaves very little chance for them to level up. On top of that  once your in a region there is no chance of changing to a more stable region unless you want to start over again. Which Sucks!!!! That needs to be changed!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.969914377,28-Oct-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,got attacked 69 times in one day while at work...69 times!!! lost all my resources and troops and was asked to  top up  to restore my resources and heal my troops faster. my first time trying a game like this  I feel I was misled by the ad on YouTube. I was under the impression that you could actually defend your own base when attacked  and actually be involved in the attack when you attack another base. I'm not done  I got more,NEGATIVE,1,0.999533892,15-Jul-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Zday doesn't fix their bugs. If Android it's been over 2 years to fix the blue commander experience bug stuck on your screen. have to log out & log back in just to reset. The newest equipment takes so much steel  when you try to redeem the steel it takes 4 hours of gameplay to redeem. Numerous old items you can't use anymore. like the yellow gold tickets & many other events taking up space in your inventory. Their event rewards are not for current items anymore. Look at the other reviews.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998967171,8-Mar-23
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,They keep adding new equipment every month  so by the time you get to a point where you've caught up  you then have to start again paying for new gear. The developers have become very greedy and instead of fixing graphics and other bug issues they are concentrating on make lots of money. I used to love this game  but now it's just a pay to win every month game instead.,NEGATIVE,1,0.989245176,16-Dec-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,I play the game frequently and spend a considerable amount levelling up. It completely frustrates me how the deals of the day/top up rewards have never included badges. You'd think you'd want to give the people who spend money leveling up a little break from time to time  but it seems greed is a constant thing on the game. I wouldn't even care if it was top up 90k gold and get 1 000 badges once a month anything would be better than nothing.,NEGATIVE,1,0.992392659,13-Aug-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,this game is terrible. The graphics are terrible and everything  and I mean EVERYTHING  costs money. You play for 2 days to finish a list of objectives only to get 1K gold (which is nothing in this game) or  the wonderful option to spend $9.99 to buy 7K gold. Congratulations  you just finished your objectives  now pay us to get some gold. if you are thinking  I will play without paying  forget about it. it will take you so long  it will be impossible and boring. Everyone will burn you.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997530282,8-Jan-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,I wasn't intending to leave a review after quitting the game last month  but I had an advertisement on YouTube for the game and it completely mis-represented the gameplay. It shown a soldier side-scrolling through an enemy base like a dungeon. This is 100% false and I'm baffled as to why they even spent money to develop and post this advert. Additionally  in the screenshots  there are stats shown over the T95 tank in which most aren't even related to the game  nor are most of the icons. Stop false advertisement. Portray your game as it is.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999643922,3-Dec-18
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Another kingdom builder. It does have alot of things you can do each day to help increase your power without having to pay  but there is definetely a benefit to spending on there. The items to shield your city from getting attacked is more expensive than other games and it does not hand them out as much. I do like the fact that you can buy the shield in increments (2HR  8HR  etc.) so you dont waste large shield items.,POSITIVE,0,0.778174758,12-Jun-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,It's decent fun with a good alliance  but the extra push notifications are not needed. I only have combat alert notification selected  but my phone is receiving notifications of home front events every 2 hours or so  resources need collecting  troops returned  etc. Please allow controls for all notifications because some alerts aren't needed in the middle of the night or whenever. Please. Irritated. Irritating.,NEGATIVE,1,0.993571043,18-Jul-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,The game was fun when I started playing. But for the last 8-10 months they have done nothing to improve game play. They bring out new gear or other items for you to upgrade but the qty of materials need to do so are so high that the only way to get them is buy them. To get current gear maxed out would cost $2000-3000 just for the materials. There is 6 different categories like this.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996343195,6-Apr-21
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,It is a very fun game  quick to build up power but be very careful about how you spend resources in your inventory and your gold. It is abundant but it costs more gold the more you progress. My only problem is how much they shove the packs in your face. A few things require you to buy something to unlock it  including challenges. I would like to see them stop monetizing the game as much as they are. Maybe for like one thing  you can use the things the game gives you and if u buy a pack you more,NEGATIVE,1,0.989338279,4-Jun-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Best game out by far! Needs a few minor adjustments like adding a feature where you can send gold/Any item to a player in need. Also noticed a war tech has a false advertisement meaning it says something but doesn't actually doing  which should just either be removed or fixed. I'm talking about the war tech that allows you to use reinforced troops from your Allience members.would give 5 stars but yeah those are my reason why I didn't give a 5 star review I hope you guys can understand. :),NEGATIVE,1,0.854284942,28-Oct-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Becoming more and more pure pay to win. Played for over a year now  and they've recently added items that you must purchase with money to continue your growth  and can not be acquired through grinding  farming  or winning contests in game. In addition to this example  they have been scaling their pay model up more and more with time  and it will only continue to get worse. Fun game  but expect to invest heavily if you wish to be competitive at all in the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998035014,24-Oct-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Absolutely rubbish game  advert for the game is nothing like it is  it is NOT a first person game. After reading review responses from the support team  they claim to not be responsible for their own games. Now if that isn't a huge warning to anyone who decides to actually put effort into something. The graphics are horrible even for the City game that it is. Popcap solitaire has better graphics. Sorry had to uninstall after 30 min time wasted.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999764979,22-Feb-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,This game is like any other greedy mmo strategy game. The resources required to level up buildings and the time for them to be completed grows exponentially larger as you play. Everything in the store is overpriced and then sold  on sale  for over 1000% off. Not to mention  this game claims to be a zombie game  but there are very few if any evidence of zombies during the gameplay  unless the game is referring to the sparse amount of mutants encountered in the game various uninteresting modes.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998560607,9-Jul-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,I'm having trouble with the game loading. It just goes to the first screen and locks up (freezes). I have not been able to get into my account for more than 3 days now.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999168038,24-Dec-23
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,It's an okay game but it's 99% pay to win. You spend so much time and try your best and then some jackass zeroes your base without any losses because he paid a hundred bucks. Edit: There is also ingame  gambling  that is evidently rigged. For example when you have 9 possible cards to open  with one very valuable one  the valuable one is ALWAYS the last one you open in this game. That's probably against the gambling laws of most countries.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997881353,11-Oct-18
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,The ad for the app had a first person shooting defence video. It's not like that at all. Base building strategy buy packs of resources to support the developer and alot of clutter on the interface screen. Nice graphics  but not so exhilarating that It was amazing. Really didn't like the bait and switch tactics from the ad.,NEGATIVE,1,0.944192588,17-Oct-18
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,I'm addicted to this game  however saying that the things you need to know. Start with a budget. The game can be very expensive if you allow it to. If you start and get comfortable with it then that's the supplies needed to bring you to the next level can be a bitc#. 70 million food resources along with other building materials. You nearly would on my budget; it's like sitting in front of mirror and seeing yourself growing older. It's like the real world.Those who have and those who Don't.ð· â ,NEGATIVE,1,0.98813951,24-Mar-20
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Can you please reimburse me for the money I have spend on this game? The game is only to be played on the base levels where you can upgrade your buildings and functions. If you go to region mode  the game crashes before you can get an attack launched. I did follow the instructions how to possibly correct this problem. I did send complaints about this issue and it is not been resolved. I want my money back. Service unsatisfactory!!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.99970907,25-Oct-18
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,There is always something to do in this game  even when waiting for construction etc. Regular rewards so don't have to buy in app to enjoy the game. The only improvement I would suggest is to the tutorial as it shows you the absolute basics so there is still alot you have to work out for yourself and it's not always easy to understand what you need to do.,NEGATIVE,1,0.990732312,14-Aug-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,Although this game is time consuming  making new friends is a plus  My only concerns is the cost of the gold packages  in which you don't get enough stuff in which you purchase  other things that are a disadvantage is that the Iron and alloy farms take to long to gather from and you don't get enough of either of them  plus there is not a whole lot of them like oil and food. The other issues is the amount of time it takes to do certain upgrades  and the amount of resources needed to do these upgrades  the amount of food that troops consume during a period when your offline  in roughly a 10 hour period while I was offline  my troops consumed over 5 million in food  even when I had everything set to  low . The good things are the fact that I've met a few people on here that really work togeather as a team  especially in my allience  overall On a scale of 1 to 5 I give this game a 3  Thank you,NEGATIVE,1,0.999190867,2-Jun-19
Z Day: Hearts of Heroes,its a good game with a intermediate learning curve. There are plenty of tutorials on you tube to help and some are a bit outdated FYI (game has been updated quite a few times). There are people who dont like the game as well due to being attacked a lot  but its a war game  go figure. good idea to hide troops with long marches to distant places hopefully no one sees your march trail(that would be nice thing to eliminate the march trail ). very complex game tks,POSITIVE,0,0.544634461,2-Jun-19
Whiteout Survival,I think the game is great! I would like to comment on a few things the game could benefit from. This is an international game. The chat needs a translation option. It can bring in more players and prevent current players from having to translate messages. The speedups are useful but  it still takes forever to level up. Especially when there are players that spend a lot to advance and you're free to play. Rewards need to be more rewarding. Spending hours grinding for a little is demotivating.,NEGATIVE,1,0.990629375,26-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,I deleted after 2 months. Wasnt worth it. Its imposible to move from 1 sector to another. You need to be max level and have 30 move passes. No one in the history of this game has been able to move. Just get rid of the option instead of being greedy. They really try hard to micro transaction everything. Cost more than a ps5 game if you add them all. The devolpers have a lot of work to do. Ill just stop playing. Kinda pointless really.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999788105,29-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,The game started out as a lot of fun. I enjoyed the building aspects  exploring  and researching. The hero characters were interesting and had fun animations. As I progressed  the game became much less fun. I was simply farmed over and over be players 40 to 50 levels higher who could bring 10 times the number of troops I could muster. The plundered resources slowed down any advancement I could make. I also never saw the mini games advertised in other games.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994933069,23-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,So early in  but I'm enjoying the added survival aspect. Something you do that isn't automated like all the 4x games are. Just grind to you have taken the huge amount of time to amass resources to raise you power/str lvl high enough to watch your units kill the enemy unit. No strategy really in any aspect of build&battle 4x games. But having to manage your survivors in more than the jobs they do  but down to their lives. Something the player actually gets to do . Thank you for hard work.,POSITIVE,0,0.988235891,26-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,This game absolutely squeaks with how tightly it holds onto rewards. New heroes are not awarded  you have to collect shards then assemble them into a hero unit. I've played for a solid 3 - 4 hours  and I've just gotten my fourth hero to deploy in battles. The theme is novel  but maybe a bit clumsy. It feels like games like this are designed on some sort of kit  with a theme applied over the top  and I'm pretty sure this one is middling at best.,NEGATIVE,1,0.985062003,31-Mar-24
Whiteout Survival,Game is fun for teaming up in alliances  a bit too much work due to school sometimes makes me get off track  addicting in the begining  slow  repetitive  to the point half of the alliance I was in has fully changed while away. Honestyly  good overall game  doesnt suit my genre though. Love this game  its just a waste of storage for a game that getts repetive.,NEGATIVE,1,0.521818221,26-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,Fun to play  a lot of exploring and great story. Characters are balanced  and the development tree is well thought. However  to finish most events you have to pay (there's always a last thing to do which is buy this and buy that and without it you won't complete it). And there's a ton of players that you can't compete against unless you play from your wallet. Would rate it higher  but these aspects kind of ruin it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997047365,28-Mar-24
Whiteout Survival,Ad is kind off misleading. It's not complete building game or strategy game  it's just something inbetween. It's a beautifuly designed game. Very well optimised also. But the thing is there is no gameplay thing. You login and collect rewards for straight 10 min. Building option is on initial level only. There is no strategy in war  you just send troops. It attacks some base and troops comes back. That's it. Many types of coins to redeem rewards. Makes things unnecessarily complicated.,NEGATIVE,1,0.991823256,18-Mar-24
Whiteout Survival,DONT INSTALL. NOT AS ADVERTISED. The game isn't like the ad. I've been playing for 2 day without seeing what was advertised. Show people what the game is actually like. Or even add the ability to play it like shown in the ads. I'll play it for a bit more and if it takes forever or that functionality isn't there then I'll keep the low rating. Bating users isn't good. Response to developers: Make the game have a mode where you can play like it is advertised. I will update the review if you do.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999504089,5-Mar-24
Whiteout Survival,The game is entertaining  and while it constantly encourages you to pay to progress. It is possible to play for free and extract some enjoyment (but you need to join an alliance which has a lot of paying players in order to get that enjoyment). Be warned  if you're unfortunate enough to need the help of Customer Support  you're likely to be disappointed. They're very polite but totally useless when it comes to getting anything fixed. There are definitely better ways to spend your time and money.,NEGATIVE,1,0.802782238,25-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,Changed my rating as I've played longer. Events are fully pay to win. Skins in themselves have no way of being obtainable unless you throw out a ton of cash into it. It isn't simple like a standard cosmetic in other games either  it is something where you have to either still pay and compete against others to obtain  or pay a high amount to get an unreasonable amount of points to obtain which getting the points falls on chance. They added one skin that is  free to obtain  no where as nice.,NEGATIVE,1,0.9988361,16-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,The most pay to win app I've ever played. You can't play for free at all. You would have to play for 1 year free to catch up to 1 hour of a pay to win player. I've dropped nearly $80 within 5 weeks of play and it still feels like I'm hitting a free to play pay wall hard. I struggle just to hit top 500 in arena and it keeps getting worse each day. There only 3 characters that are only obtained in the VIP store and cost hundreds of dollars to upgrade and level up.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999612391,22-Mar-24
Whiteout Survival,Honestly  I just wanted to play the game in the ad and I was very disappointed to see that this game is nothing like that. It's an alright game. The graphics and story are nice and the voice acting is surprisingly good but there's often way too much happening at once and those build times are ridiculous. It gets to a point where you research something  have to upgrade to unlock the next one and then you have to wait five hours only for it to repeat. It's stupid and makes me not want to play.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996517062,26-Feb-24
Whiteout Survival,Definitely a pay to play game. If you don't spend money  it will take a very long time to advance. The one thing that I think the game makers should change is the hunting. Stamina takes forever to replenish. As one of the things that a free to play player can do regularly  stamina should take half the time to replenish and it shouldn't cost so much to hunt. It's one way that free to players can have some sort of fun on this game. Otherwise it's not even worth it. very expensive game to play.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998414636,16-Mar-24
Whiteout Survival,The upgrade building UI feels clunky and unresponsive. After you reach a certain level the game becomes basically all PvP with little to no PvE options. Not a survival game  contradictory to the title. You can definitely sink hours into the game with just two characters on the same server/state  in the same alliance  lowering cooldowns and helping beat beasts  but the game offers no new real content once you get to say level 16. You're also spammed with offers to spend real money on everything.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999558747,20-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,This game has become just like all the others hurry up and build. Then you must pay to keep up after a certain point to keep up with the players from Asian countries  that either made the game or are just dumping boat loads of money into it. It's also become very stale and stagnant  as there has been no server merges or I'm my servers case no one wants to fight. Oh we have NAP with top 5 so you can't farm anyone or attack anything. It's become quite boring. No new real additions to the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999815404,24-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,After 3/28/24 update  I frequently experience connection issue. Sometimes I can't send a message  like the messaging feature stops working. Prior to this i never experienced any technical issues. My inet connection is stable (wired  fios). Hoping this would be fixed or else I'll stop playing this game. P.S. Deleted and reinstalled the game  issue was fixed.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997055173,5-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,Downloaded this game through Mistplay and this app has some real connection issues. It took forever to download  then it had to upload  and then every other second it would freeze. I wasn't wasting my time to try and re-download the game. The graphics looked elementary at best & these kinds of games are numerous. Nothing really stood out enough to me to make me keep the app.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997738838,5-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,This isn't a bad game. But it is very confused. The ads make it seem sort of like a city Sim  but that lasts only a couple days. There is an  exploration  element that doesn't really tie into the rest of the game. Also  why do I have 30 000 troops protecting 32 towns people? Long story short  it's a simplified and more manageable take on Star Trek Fleet Commander. I wish they would just embrace that.,NEGATIVE,1,0.991482019,13-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,Pros: Easy to use  haven't come by any ads  resources pretty easy to obtain  including the main currency  but is time consuming  alliances can help you build and research faster  heros are also easy to obtain without really spending money to get them. Cons: some things are behind a paywall. Packs don't include an even number of the 4 resources  you'll always receive less coal than wood. Buildings can't be placed just wherever. Your alliance can't help train your troops. Nothing like the ads.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996368408,28-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,It would be a great game  IF there would be an option to pay monthly fee and choose a server to compete with other player skills  instead of wallets. Wallet Warriors are killing whole fun of the game by handing over facilities  castles (no  you don't win it in a battle) or just taking over everything and zeroing players they don't like  just because they can (cause they bought upgrades). Until people got enough and just quit.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997508407,20-Mar-24
Whiteout Survival,The graphic is great. But 'A lot of things are starting to get boring. 1. we upgrading buildings/characters our eyes are on the upgrade display.(no animation even tho' Graphic designer does put animation) 2. RPG style of fighting.(TapÂ² then ends) 3. Attack & Defense (anyone can attack you) 4. Upgrade is too fast & has a lot of levels (making people eager to purchase everything) We end up upgrading everything without enjoying game progress  worst part is already have MAXED OUT Alliances members.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998691499,8-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,Downloaded this game just so I could give it 1*. Never played it  but I get ads for it all the time that freeze and don't work  not even the  install  button. Of course these companies pay for ads  so it's no surprise that other reviews talk about how the game is a p2w money grab. Maybe they wouldn't have to spend so much on marketing if they were smart enough to design ads that work. But if they can't even design a working 30-second ad  the game is probably just as poorly-designed.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999804676,13-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,Play only if you have time...this game is way too addictive and in the first week or so you will end up spending hours if you dont be cautious. Things slow down a bit as upgrade time increases. However  there are still a lot of things going around which will make you come back to it. This is not a time killer  this is addiction. Be very cautious of what you are downloading. Best part is you can progress through levels without spending money.,NEGATIVE,1,0.987574756,26-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,I've been playing on and off  more off than on  for many year's. They've gone from a okay game to pure garbage  automated help  that doesn't help  and only reward's are for big money Spenders in game  makes everything unbalanced  unfun  and totally not fair. And the only help you get from the game  you get told to buy their packs. Not worth wasting your time  unless you enjoy wasting a lot of money.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999019146,15-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,This game has great potential but it became too much p2w. It made you spend a lot and doesn't even inform you about upcoming updates  we were fighting a war against other state  we were leading towards a battle of almost equal power  same stats  same power level battle and in between the war preparation stage they announced a new update without informing earlier and made the other state have stronger chances to win in just 30 minutes.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998636067,26-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,The game can feel simplistic and overwhelming to start with. But as you progress the gameplay builds up. The good thing about this game is that you do not have to spend a tonne or money or watch any ads in game to level up. If you are patient  you can unlock a day long gameplay experience with zero dollar spend. Of course being part of an active clan is very important  else the game can get boring after about 20 levels or so.,POSITIVE,0,0.921693802,28-Mar-24
Whiteout Survival,I've spent 418 continuous days (and counting) playing this game and as such I'll leave my honest review. This is a Play-To-Win game but one can still be competitive without spending a dime in-game. I know because I've only done 3 purchases (5USD each) throughout the entire time. 2 were for avatar frames  the other 1 was for chief gear scrolls. I'm CF5  though I won't be able to stand toe to toe to a whale CF8  combat wise  I'm able to withstand solo attacks from <CF7. Darn  I've reached limit,POSITIVE,0,0.956755161,24-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,Overall animations are great  heroes are fine (certainly can be improved)  but the rest is mediocre. Nothing special for me to keep playing for a long time because settlement building isn't the main point of this game. Let's say the upgrades of heroes skills is the one. You should have utilized heroes in a better way  like in Dota 2 or Clash Royale.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998682439,5-Mar-24
Whiteout Survival,I will renew my review for this game. This game is awesome but there's a minor difference. Like  everytime I click for special attacks of heroes in exploration the notification cooldown keeps pop ups every click. Even after i play it keeps popping up. I hope you will minimize this. And i also suggest that in recruiting heroes with using 10 gold keys or 10 platinum keys you will add a free xp or resources.,POSITIVE,0,0.77313596,29-Mar-24
Whiteout Survival,This is a cool game with a lot of fun things to do. BUT.. you need stamina to play  and it runs out quickly with no way to recharge quickly other than to buy packs. Also  to keep upgrading buildings  troops  etc. You need to buy packs to get anywhere. The dev are making a ton of money on this game  that's why I can only give a 3 star rating. There needs to be less time waiting for upgrades and training. And stamina should be offered as gifts in rally  lighthouse  and other daily play.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997269928,16-Mar-24
Whiteout Survival,It is a good game but !!! Like everything  I am on furnace 20  and now it's starting to drag. I have wasted a ton of money I don't really want to waste no more it's getting boring now to the point I can't be bothered to play with it it's not a bad game at all unless you are willing to spend money to get moving faster the graphic are good I like the hero's and the building a city up,POSITIVE,0,0.86011976,24-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,Game is ok  but completely pay to win - most things can't actually be finished without spending money. As well as that  in server vs server (a battle that lasts 24hours and you must participate or shield) the shields cost a ridiculous amount of gems and it will now cost me over Â£500 to heal my troops  or about 1month free. Absolutely ridiculous losing months worth of work to then have to pay half a grand to get it back?,NEGATIVE,1,0.996886432,27-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival, Whiteout Survival lacks enjoyable gameplay and offers little entertainment value. The presence of high-powered players on numerous servers makes strategic play ineffective  as success heavily relies on purchasing speed-up packs. It's not a fair play-to-win game; rather  it's a pay-to-win scenario where paying players dominate alliances. Even joining top alliances doesn't guarantee success  as slow progression without speed-up purchases is inevitable. Overall  the game's structure heavily favors,NEGATIVE,1,0.99959749,24-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,To be honest out of all the survival games ive played this one ive found is the best for me. Easier to understand  uncomplicated aetup  things arent tiny like its supposed to played on a computer not a phone. Im just hoping i can play this game for years and i wont need to spend money at a certain time to actually use the game. Recommended,POSITIVE,0,0.981045365,24-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,I have played this game since March of 23. I have enjoyed the people I've met here  and also enjoyed the game it's self. That said they are dropping new gear and heros and upgrades at a rate that no one but people who pay thousands of dollars monthly can keep up! I already pay somewhere between 4 to 8 hundred a month and I am being left behind  and I play with a major alliance with P2W even then there is no hope of competing with out spending even more. It is getting to be much for anyone.,POSITIVE,0,0.991564512,26-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,This game is getting better with each update. I'm reading old reviews amd have noticed some improvements. There are optional ads for extra rewards. Occasionally you get a simple question about game play  sometimes there are optional surveys that you get in-game rewards for. Today I found out that they actually read these amd use them to improve the game. A message was sent out thanking the players and describing recent and future updates.,POSITIVE,0,0.909298837,25-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,If anyone tricks you  to download the game  just don't. You'll get frustrated after a day our two staring at the screen  being unable to do anything without investing real money in  packs! You'll be just grinding meat for the players who do invest .. Energy is the worst  after doing a few daily missions  and if you're lucky  4 rallies you're done  left without energy for activities for the next 7/8 hours . The only purpose of this game us to drain your wallet.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999814093,25-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,This game was fun I could spend a little and still be competitive  the last patch for legendary hero gear just made it impossible to even come close to being competitive to the mega whale. Don't play unless your prepared to lose and keep losing unless you ready to drop a inheritance on this game. Way to go devs. You really messed up a good thing buy being way too greedy. This is the beginning of the end. RIP WOS,NEGATIVE,1,0.99497813,24-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,I've bee playing this game for the past 3 days it took me away from 1945 Airforce because of the Ad... LOVE IT!! I would continue to play BUT sadly  I have to uninstall ..would gladly spend money to play this game  but I dont have a credit or debit card.. I leave ONLY BECAUSE you can only pay to win.. the length of time for upgrades is CRRRRAZY without PURCHASES and you have ADVANCED LEVEL players scouting and attacking NEW players to the game Alliance not helping and TIME WASTED.Sad to go.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998742759,24-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,This game is a money grab. Unless you are willing to spend a thousand dollars per month on purchased upgrades  yiy can't be competitive. You will get beat upon by players that do. There is nothing in game to prevent this from happening. The events will pair players with maxed out gear against new players. (ie Frostfire mine) so free to play players never have any hope of winning rewards to advance. Each update is only adding more stuff to purchase to become more powerful widening the power gap,NEGATIVE,1,0.99885726,26-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,Just like other war games it's a lot of play to win. I've been playing this game now for almost a year. After a certain point you have to start spending or your progress is slower then a snail. A lot of the features they've been adding have been nice lately but a lot of them are just remakes of old past events.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994987726,11-Mar-24
Whiteout Survival,Awesome game to play in your down time. Its passive nature doesn't make it a chore and all the different events that get rotated in and out keep it fresh and fun. Been playing daily for months now and still love it.,POSITIVE,0,0.999825895,29-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,Won't let me delete account! I created my alliance and got members right away but after 2 days one specific alliance bombarded us with attacks! They attacked me 32x in 5hrs!!! That's not counting what they did to the others in my group. I almost deleted the game bc of that. Now I've maxed out most of my upgrades  idk what to do once that's finished. This game has a lot of potential. There should be an option to disallow attacks OR a limit to how many attacks you can do per day/to the same group.,POSITIVE,0,0.941207945,28-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,playing around for a year and still playing everyday   in play games are nice and entertaining also rewards  heroes all are ok .

Whiteout Survival,Not the game in the ads! I downloaded this based on the video ads but the actual content is NOTHING like them - this is a generic pay-to-win war game where unless you spend money on packs your development will be stunted and you'll get smashed by higher level players. Not saying that people don't like a war game  obviously they do  but the way this game is marketed is totally misleading,NEGATIVE,1,0.999723613,27-Apr-24

Whiteout Survival,This game is a pay-to-win for sure. You can be kinda powerful  but you must grind like crazy while other people grow strong easily through cash burning. However  friendship is what saves this game  they know what to do to mobilize players. I quit the game as I'm writing this mostly because of that and the repetitive events too.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99049437,28-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,They're scamming you into downloading. Every single advertisement is a different style of game. The actual game is nothing like the ads and is just a basic city builder where you have to constantly keep your kingdom up or people raid you and steal all your supplies. I am extremely disappointed with the false advertising and the terrible automated reply to bad reviews. You do not need suggestions  you made all those misleading ads. That's the game folks want. Make the game you advertise.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999232888,20-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. The devs have lost their mind. The recent update made it cost 100k American dollars to fully.max 4 pieces of gear for one hero. So it'll cost 300k to fully max the gear for a march of 3 hereos. And that's just the gear not including maxing a hero easy 10k unless you grind for months. Then chief gear easy 10k again unless a year+ grinding. STAY AWAY THIS GAME IS ONLY AFTER YOUR MONEY. It's not even a good game to play gets boring fast,NEGATIVE,1,0.999748051,24-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,Now don't get me wrong I really enjoyed this game and brought a number of packs in my year plus playing. However my account has since been restricted  as applying for 3 refunds over the space of a year for purchases made in error warrants that. No warning. And to unlock they want me to pay Â£15. Speaking to customer service got me a copy and paste response and since ignored. Wasted a lot of money on this game and probably would of wasted more. What a shame.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998306632,18-Mar-24
Whiteout Survival,My city was attacked  but it wasn't completely ruined the first time  but my city was on fire. With heavy casualties. There isn't a way to trace the aggressor to retaliate. I did reach out about this. Nothing has changed. The second attack happened this morning. My city was unshielded. I would have shielded it  but there was maintenance being done yesterday. It interfered with doing anything. I had to do this thing called sleep and didn't get the chance. Some advanced notifications would help.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997681975,28-Mar-24
Whiteout Survival,Not really a survival simulator. So don't bother if that's what you are looking for. Definitely a P2W game. Need to drop about hundred a week to keep in the top 100 on your server. Some players have dropped 5 figures in 6 months. Many rotating events that are re skinned and recycled. Extremely repetitive if that's your jam. Not many events catering to the US time zones. Unless you have a free hour during the middle of the work day,NEGATIVE,1,0.999735415,21-Mar-24
Whiteout Survival,The gameplay is absolutely nothing like what's shown in the fake ads. The real gameplay is very basic  and while ok for a while  it doesn't take long to get boring. You can't progress far without either waiting ridiculously long times or by paying lots of money. It essentially becomes a pay to win or pay to play game.,POSITIVE,0,0.632260442,29-Mar-24
Whiteout Survival,Not a bad game all around but the town is limited in size and certain resources only trickle in unless you continuously purchase packs which limits the amount of time spent playing each day. The ability to increase chiefs and heros power levels is entirely dependant on wallet thickness and not primarily based on successful gameplay. The expenses of earning the event rewards always exceeds the reward value. Basically the game is just a well executed money trap.,NEGATIVE,1,0.971883893,9-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,The game is fun and you can advance ig you play hours but at one point it become almost imposible  the time and resources you need exceed the limits... Your asked to expand the territory for nothing  i thought if i put landmarks on resources they will be captured and i will enjoy them but nothing... Evrerything in the game become repetitive at one point  no more building animation changes when you upgrade  nothing... Its a game to play for a week and move on..,NEGATIVE,1,0.996495664,23-Mar-24
Whiteout Survival,Starts off well but turns into a relentless grind of upgrading settlement buildings. You can upgrade faster if you pay but I don't want to  consequently upgrading the furnace last time took 1 day and 14 hours.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998110175,25-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,Probably one of the best mobile game experiences since Bloons TD. Everything functions well  and you are not locked into paying for things if you do not wish to. There are plenty of purchase abilities but they only enhance the user experience. I have been playing for months and the only qualm I can see is how long it takes to build In the late game stages. The dev team really listens to user input. And I have had a lot of fun with this one.,POSITIVE,0,0.992636442,24-Apr-24
Whiteout Survival,after giving it some time and some serious grinding I've come to notice that upgrading the furnace (currently level 17) the temp only saves .2 degrees heat at night and 4 degrees during the day from the initial start level. clans never help with beast/monster quests (not games fault) my happiness level is 98% and I'm seriously finding an issue of why to continue playing at this point cause it's just character level and furnace leveling left and the amount of time for the furnacebis a joke.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997227728,30-Mar-24
Whiteout Survival,Fun game very addicting. Totally play to win. Hide your troops spend your loot or use a shield. Shields are hard to come by for free to play players. You get some early on but they don't last long as the strong players pulverize you. Shields should be easier to obtain. If you spend be advised that your state dies rather quickly leaving you with an expensive account in a dead state. Game gets boring and more like a job after a couple weeks.. that's all I got..good luck!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.993521154,9-Apr-24

Teen Patti Gold -3 Patti Rummy,Initially  I found it enjoyable  but my perspective shifted due to what appears to be excessive profit-oriented practices by the developers. Their primary focus seems to be compelling users into subscribing to a monthly scheme  ostensibly for token rewards. Unfortunately  once subscribed  their algorithms seemingly lead to significant losses. Adding to the concerns is the apparent lack of moderation for players who engage in posting racist and offensive comments towards their peers.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99870491,6-Feb-24

Roblox,Although this game is fun to play with others  and the updates have been fun for a good amount of time the game glitches most of the time I play  despite changing the devices/wifi I'd play on the problem wasnt ultimately solved  as you get older it is definitely harder to find games to enjoy  the controls have been more faulty recently  you cant move the screen or jump while running or walking. With all these factors to consider  roblox overall has held up but needs to work out a few kinks.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998779833,28-Apr-24
Roblox,My kids been playing it for a while. Would give u a full rating if not for the payment problem I'm having right now. This purchase was not completed is so annoying.

Roblox,I get kicked out every 30 seconds. I've reinstalled  updated  everything  and it's always kicking me out. It's getting a little ridiculous to the point I don't even want to play anymore. New setup is horrible. You have to scroll all the way down to get to games you usually play. I don't want your recommendation or your  picks  for me. I want to play what I like  no need for all the extra. But seriously the kicking you out every 30 seconds is unreal.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999105871,28-Apr-24
Roblox,Well it's still great I guess. there some bugs that I get everytime. And most of the time  when it updates and I updated it  I can't get into the game and stuck in the loading screen no matter what my internet connection's quality is  I had to reinstall the game and I can play it again like nothing happened. I've tried to play something else when It's stuck in loading screen  and It worked  my internet is fine.

Roblox,This game is WONDERFUL! After years of using it  it improved! And my friends are also amazed of what this game has. But my only problem are the controller or also called joysticks.

I keep switching  my dynamic controller  reseting my character but it does not work or fully function. I hope Roblox will fix this problem.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998119771,23-Apr-24
Roblox,AMAZING GAME!! So many ways to customize your avatar  you can make lifelong friends  and even play with loved ones! One minor issue is that it's crashing my computer sometimes. That however is on me for having a horrible quality computer. ð If you have a low quality device  turn your graphics down when it starts to freeze up before its too late! You can meet up with friends and talk in voice  or in the public chat! Overall  this is a 9.9/10 game for me! Just crashes my game sometimes. XD,NEGATIVE,1,0.995644689,21-Apr-24
Roblox,This game engine has a lot of games  almost like a library to choose from. But there are minor issues that rarely occur  like sometimes the camera bugs out  and the player cannot rotate or move it to look around. Second  sometimes the ping is way too high  even though I have a stable and powerful wifi connection. And lastly  some games tend to crash in the middle of playing or they are unoptimised.

Roblox,Hey! Just to let you know the app itself is 5 definitely but there's 1 bug that annoys me the most  The bug is when you move with your joystick  your camera seems to do the same where the joystick is pointing. I can't really explain it since I'm not rlly sure how to but  my recommendation to this game is to add like a control settings like where you pick the size or the location of the joystick. That all thx.â¤ï¸,NEGATIVE,1,0.9831025,14-Apr-24
Roblox,I love this game. However I have been kicked out of multiple accounts and lost severe progress on some of the in app games. When I go to log in  it says my password is incorrect and doesn't let me reset my password so I can log into my account. If this problem is fixed I would definitely give the app 5 stars but since I'm on my 3rd or 4th account now I can't until this problem is either fixed or a way to have multiple accounts to play on without having to sign out of one to get into another,NEGATIVE,1,0.995002449,15-Apr-24
Roblox,The game itself is a top 10 - 20 game all time  but  unless you own a high end phone dont download it  it takes minutes just for a keyboard to come up in game  minutes to join a game  crashes constantly  gives me VC warnings for saying something that could maybe be mistaken for a bad word  even when I have my mic off. I don't recommend you get this  especially if you have a laptop newer than 2018  or a ps4/5 or Xbox One/X/S. Just get it on there.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996692657,28-Apr-24
Roblox,A fast and easy way for children to be mentally focused in new subjects and objectives. This game is quite nice for children that are in the growing stage.

Roblox,Roblox is amazing!!!!It has so many different types of games! It also has the games which show in ads. I love this but the only problem is that sometimes the screen like zooms in or out when I touch it but I found a solution how to overcome.We can go to setting and change the camera mode and the problem will be gone.And also there is this problem when it automatically keeps jumping and to stop it just press the top most left hand side corner button and then close it and the problem will be done,NEGATIVE,1,0.985856295,24-Apr-24
Roblox,Amazing game. I've been playing roblox for 4 years now  and it sure was a hit. The game is really good and there isn't a lot of lag but there's an issue some times when I go into the game and zoom in or out some times  I can't control myself anymore. And no I am not a PC user so I can't move with WASD. So roblox corporation  please fix this issue. Overall 10/10 Amazing game.,POSITIVE,0,0.999539256,26-Apr-24
Roblox,Now Roblox isn't necessarily a game it self  it a platform to build games which I really like about it. It's not just the same thing over and over again  It's a choose what you want and you get it  but it's not five stars because it's pretty laggy on mobile and micro transactions are a important part which bugs me  but it kinda needs some way to get money that's fare.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996970296,29-Apr-24
Roblox,Roblox is a great game but their are some problems that come with huge games that make millions of dollars every year. For example  on Mobile when you're playing a game and someone send you a friend request it use to be at the bottom of the jump button but they changed it. Instead  it takes up the whole screen. When playing games it can be difficult to play. Another problem I have is how small the jump button is. I know sone of you IOS and mobile players agree. But anyway there are a few more.,NEGATIVE,1,0.990114212,24-Apr-24
Roblox,The game is good  there's so many things you can pick to play. The avatar is amazing  you can dress it up to your liking. The game is also smooth  depends on what type of gadgets you're using. But there's one problem that I've been dealing with and that is the bug. I can't click anything in some games. For example  you joined a server and It asks you to click something to pick it up but for some reason  it won't click at all. I re downloaded the game and It just keeps happening. Please fix this,POSITIVE,0,0.89918226,21-Apr-24
Roblox,Great app and super fun and can keep you entertained for hours only small problem is as soon as you get a slight drop in WiFi the game starts lagging like crazy and will freeze. Also  a notice for people with chromebooks  don't get it for chromebook as it never works no matter your WiFi and will kick you out of a game after a while. I used to be able to play for hours on chromebook but since recent updates  the game seems to have gotten worse. Definitely a no go for chromebook users.,NEGATIVE,1,0.988965273,5-Apr-24
Roblox,It's a very nice game! However on mobile it bugs a lot like the sky giltches sometimes and it randomly zooms in the camera not letting us move it only of we leave  I also can't move sometimes or jump and sometimes a game even like Brookhaven giltches a lot with colorful static around the ground and sky to the point I can't see anything but colorful things  also there's a big problem with the report system  my friend said hi and got banned even though she didn't do anything!. PLEASE FIX THIS!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.982383728,12-Apr-24
Roblox,This game is great and all but you need to make a way to get free robux. Some people don't have a chance to get free robux or they don't have enough money to buy it. I also would like an animation update because avatars move weirdly. Also  I also play on VR and have noticed some bugs with gameplay. I would also enjoy more skin colors because I cannot find a skin color that looks like mine. Overall  you have a great game. But I would like to see some changes.,POSITIVE,0,0.993255854,20-Apr-24
Roblox,The game is just a fun game with tons of other fun games in it  I like the feature that each game has a different topic though I see no problems and the best part is no ads unless you click on a game's ad it is the most best part cause usually many games have ads in it.

Roblox,I love the game! But there's one small but terrible problem most of the mobile device users encounter. It's when for example you're playing a game with a joystick similar to bloxfruit's  the joystick would randomly move on its own. And I hate it. Especially when I'm on an important stuffs such as doing  PVP 's  it hella stresses me everytime! Please fix this. But I'll still give 5 stars because this is my hobby,NEGATIVE,1,0.991538942,16-Apr-24
Roblox,Love the game. But for some reason  when i try to join an experience/ game/ server it kicks me out with the error message  Kicked due to unexpected client behavior  EVEN THOUGH i did nothing. usually when i turn on a vpn the error gets fixed almost immediatley but now  when i turn it on it just logs me out of my account COMPLETELY. and does not let me log in even after waiting half an hour. plus  it crashes SO MANY TIMES. please fix this bug so i and maybe other people can play.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997726142,18-Apr-24
Roblox,Buying a one month premium is still buggy as hell. When I try to renew my premium  it won't let me get it  alongside losing money for it. Everytime I buy for a slight amount of robux on this game  (Not a pay to win or something) It still counts as a additional from premium users. But still  I haven't seen the extra 8 or 40 when I buying a 80-400 robux. Please do kind that my payment for this will be fixed  welled assure. I need my premium back for a long time period.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994592726,24-Apr-24
Roblox,I always enjoy how great they updates the game like dynamic faces  new skin tones and a new upgraded animation for free! And I always battle with my sis when I play murder mystery 2 . It's really fun but maybe you could fix some stuff like  perhaps I bought a shirt for 7 robux and then later I discover that it isn't in my inventory. I feel like I just got scammed so please return it :( . But overall  this is a fantastic game  no wonder it's the 2nd most popular game in the world! :D,POSITIVE,0,0.996781588,25-Apr-24
Roblox,This games amazing  ive been playing since 2016 and have made many accounts.

I hate this so much and have gone through way too many accounts for this to keep happening  Roblox please fix this.,NEGATIVE,1,0.990054846,28-Apr-24
Roblox,It's a good game but recently  I'm encountering a problem. When I try to play a game   kicked out due to unexpected client behavior  appears.

Roblox,It glitches for me on my computer and mobile device. Love the game  but I wish the glitching could stop every time i go on moblie  the screen will freeze  or the character stops moving. Also  on my computer  it just glitches like mobile and kicks me out. It's kicked me off a couple of times on my phone  but just way less than my computer  it's every time. I hope they can fix it,NEGATIVE,1,0.998688161,31-Mar-24
Roblox,5/5 absolutely love this game! Could use some bug fixing tho- Bug #1: Since I'm on mobile there are certain times I can't move my screen and I I try to it just zooms in or zoom out  but I found a way to fix it: Just go in the Roblox menu and then come out  and there you have it! (Might not work on some games) Bug #2: I always meet new friends so I always try to send them friend request  but it won't allow me and when I ask most times they say the don't have 200 friends  and me? 100 so yeah 5/5.,POSITIVE,0,0.927745163,16-Apr-24
Roblox,It's a pretty good platform game and has a lot to offer for free. It has really everything for all ages of people and brings a lot of ideas to the table. However  even though this is the simpler version of Roblox  there's a lot less to experience. Like how mobile players have a limited customization variation for the avatar editor  or less buttons to work with  bad screen crunch and not being able to edit and make games entirely. But if you are able to look past these issues  it's great.,POSITIVE,0,0.998860598,2-Mar-24
Roblox,This game is quite great honestly. Although there are some bugs in the game that would kick you out of the entire app. Like in Royale high  when you try to teleport somewhere  you just get kicked out. Also  in high-quality games  when you simply enter the game for like 2 seconds  it would just kick you out. Sometimes when your playing a survival game on a chromebook  you can't do certain controls because the system automatically thinks your on a mobile device. I find that extremely annoying.,NEGATIVE,1,0.763380647,8-Mar-24
Roblox,I love this game so much! i used to play alot of roblox games for entertainment and have fun  but there is a bug that keeps happening on my phone. My screen keeps on glitching  for example  the screen was completely paralyzed and i couldn't move or fix it. The only option is to leave the game  then the glitch happens again at a random time. Why i rated 3 stars? It's because my screen keeps freezing. please reconsider to fix it  it irritates me. Thank you!,NEGATIVE,1,0.998159349,8-Mar-24
Roblox,This game is one of  if not the best of my favorite games. However  theres a bug which causes a large spike in lag when you look at the sky in certain games  no matter where you are located. The sky also appears to be glitching out. The only way this is fixed is with low graphics quality or if the game has a custom skybox  most likely from the marketplace.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998521388,28-Mar-24
Roblox,It's an awesome game. I love it  except the lag  even with proper WiFi. The game still lags in some cases. You have to fix this. Also  there is a phone glitch. The game needs to be horizontal  but instead  it's sometimes vertical. You NEED to fix this! But I'll rate this game 5 stars anyway. It's absolutely awesome  and I think you should keep up the good work and spread the game to bring smiles across the world!ððððð (FIX THOSE [AND DELETE STITCH FACE] GLITCHESSSS),POSITIVE,0,0.999165773,11-Feb-24
Roblox,Great game. But something that really frustrates me with it is how forced realistic clothing items are in the marketplace. There should be some sort of feature where you can search for a specific category of items  like searching *specifically* for classic shirts  rather than having a bunch of realistic items flood the search results with no way to change it. Maybe there is a feature like this one? If there is  it needs to be more intuitive.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995187283,19-Mar-24
Roblox,This game is great  literally is my childhood  plus it's a nice place to also socialize with people. Ever since I've started playing it  i can tell that it's a really nice game for people at all ages. The only two things i can tell is that you should...fix the reporting a little: i mean  there's a lot of mean people out there in most games  but when you report them  it just doesn't work. The second one is the jump button problem: it's just that I'd like for the button change scale feature.,NEGATIVE,1,0.791176438,1-Mar-24
Roblox,The game is great  it's just  it's run like it's a project that was abandoned  there are so many minor inconveniences that make everything worse in a sense  for example  if you reconnect when you disconnect from a server  you go to a new server. This is especially annoying in Private servers. Some of these inconveniences are not only exclusive to the app on phones  but also the computer download,NEGATIVE,1,0.99928242,30-Mar-24
Roblox,Roblox is an amazing game but could use a few improvements. One example is that when playing on mobile  the jump button is insanely small so if you need press it quickly to jump to another platform  you just fall and lose your progress. This has happened to me many times on mobile. If this was fixed I would definitely rate this game a 5 because it is ad free  has multi-player and single player games and has lots of great games to chose from. Definitely recommend.,POSITIVE,0,0.969205797,24-Feb-24
Roblox,One app with a wide variety of games to choose from  has no lag or issues. If you have a kid  definitely recommend it if he/she is above the age of 9. ALSO! 1 small bug I've noticed recently that has been happening is that people's screens are freezing/can't be moved  don't worry  I found a solution! Click the Roblox icon on the top left of your screen (when in a game) and then exit out of the menu and now your screen can move! (if your camera doesn't move at all),NEGATIVE,1,0.991603315,4-Mar-24
Roblox,Edit: The glitch is happening a lot less! Still needs work for mobile players  but I'm willing to change my 2 star rating to a 4! OG Post: I experience the same glitch! Something happens in the game  and I can no longer move around. When I try to move  the camera zooms in and out. It's so frustrating because I have to leave the game and restart in order to correct it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999336898,18-Mar-24
Roblox,I have played this for three to four years now  and I love it. An amazing simulation game to play. On mobile (iPad) it kicks you out if you don't have the right iOS? But on PC and other mobile phones and devices it works just fine. On mobile you get the occasional kick out and on PC you get the confusing weekly update but it doesn't take too long. Millions of games to choose from  and pretty good for 5 year olds and over with the chat filter. Amazing game  you should totally try it.,POSITIVE,0,0.999704063,28-Mar-24
Roblox,This game is very fun.I can control my character and i can name my own character anything i want! There are also different games for different type of people in this game. However  sometimes it is very laggy and due to that  there could be glitches for example  when I walk forward  it will shift my camera to look up at the sky.,NEGATIVE,1,0.951538563,29-Apr-24
Roblox,It's a good game! It has all the genre of what kind you want to play and it shows creativity of all that creates roblox games! But one TINY problem is that when i wanted to plug in my mobile keyboard for roblox and played a game with it but it's not the keyboard that's the problem. The mouse that is connected to the keyboard. While i was using the mouse  it sort of worked but not really of what i expected compared to PC vers. But this had a limit to how many times i can look around the area..,NEGATIVE,1,0.979752183,24-Apr-24
Roblox,Love it  Roblox experience is amazing  had it for 3 years now but only now decided to rate lol. Only issue is that I can't play some games when I'm on mobile  I just crash. Not all games  most work  some just straight up crash but this is only on mobile  on PC and laptop everything works perfectly fine. So please see if you can fix this mobile game crash issue  thanks!!. Overall best platform ever  I look back to the past three years and do not regret installing Roblox at all. ð« ,POSITIVE,0,0.997491121,12-Apr-24
Roblox,Why did you move the friends list? It looks terrible. There's no point. U could just make a spot below the continue playing list for the  today's picks . It used to be able to get to friends  just scroll alll the way up. But now I have to scroll down a bit. It looks terrible. I love Roblox  and the friends list position is my only complaint. In other words  please move the friends list back  but great job on everything else.,NEGATIVE,1,0.991622269,9-Apr-24
Roblox,Love the game but one thing is if you play on mobile  the friend request comes on the bottom of your screen  where the jump button is  nothing wrong with that. Imagine you are playing an obby  you are on the last one  you jump  and a random freind request comes  after I fell  just a request that u change that a little  but the game is AWESOME!! â¤ï¸,POSITIVE,0,0.996115088,24-Apr-24
Roblox,It's OK. I've been on this platform for years. A long time fan since 2014  and i've seen a lot of great games come and go. I've even made my own games that got some attention. What I don't like is how the app slowly starts eating up your storage with whatever you played and doesn't get rid of it after. It's very annoying to reinstall every time it exceeds 5gb of storage usage  and for what? What requires 5GB? Please reduce the usage of storage so we have space for things like memories.,NEGATIVE,1,0.935750067,6-Apr-24
Roblox,I love this game so much but I feel like we need more update and Roblox needs to stop deleting my headless and more then not giving me my refound back is so annoying I hope y'all fix this problem I am so tired of buying more robux just because I don't get my refund back and it keeps kicking me out the game and murder mystery 2  you need to stop the hitbox and the explorers and the people that use deta and we need more updates and new knives's and effect from murder mystery. Thank you so much!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.997172415,29-Apr-24
Roblox,Roblox is great  I've met a lot of people and played a ton of games. But I have a few issues. First  half the time  I'm not told when I need an update  and sometimes the screen gets bugged out and won't move. Also  I HATE how the moderation team is useless! This has been an issue for a long time. Also  stop telling roblox to fix the lag  they CANNOT fix that! That's your problem  not theirs! Get better internet or a better phone. Overall  it's a great game  just a few bugs.,NEGATIVE,1,0.969135344,25-Feb-24
Roblox,I love it and it's really great to play with  But there's was a problem whenever I join a server I got disconnected and if I check my WiFi it's stable and then my screen suddenly got all black and I can't play I need to restart again to get back to normal. So there's was one time I play and suddenly my joystick moves itself and I can't touch or move it. THAT'S ALL THANKS.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994943798,16-Apr-24
Roblox,It's a nice game  but on my brother and my experience was AWFUL. I kept getting  You were kicked out due to unexpected client behavior   I literally have not played any games yet. The games are absolutely Beautiful  but the way Roblox is acting makes it so much more boring. I can't play any games since yesterday and last week  I had to make like 7 accounts just to play TOH. Please fix this issue.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998427868,28-Apr-24
Roblox,One of the best games to go to if you're bored and what's better is that it's multiplayer. But of course  problems always finds their way in. First one I'd like to point out is that on mobile  sometimes the screen freezes into a specific view of your avatar. Also  there are some very concerning games/clothing/ items on Roblox that shouldn't be in a children's game at all. At times  the game kicks me out even though my wifi is good,POSITIVE,0,0.648539186,5-Apr-24
Roblox,Updating this after 4 years lol. Very good app  can run smooth for the most part as long as u have good connection  and has exceeded it's levels of moderation becoming much more efficient. My review isn't about the app itself  but more so the contents and games within. Games are a cash grab now  unless u find a game specific to ur interest or u enjoy repetition then it's hard to find a good game compared to back in 2016-2019. It's hard to find a large branch of good games.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994238615,15-Apr-24
Roblox,This app refuses to work on my current device  a Galaxy A14. I try to join a game but then it crashes my wifi entirely because it spikes to 50 000 ping. Yes 50 thousand. I've tried everything  reseting my router and phone  Uninstaller and reinstalling the app  updating it and my device software and even changing some wifi settings yet nothing changed.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999551833,28-Apr-24
Roblox,I honestly kinda hate this game. Yeah I can make any kind of avatar I want  but I have to pay real money for it  in fine with doing that but most people can't. Second when I have good wifi or even full bars it brings me to the log in screen and says  connection error  and this is VERY annoying. When I'm trying to play a game it randomly kicks me out  and much more! I'm not going to quit yet but the new updates are making me think about it  they are more like downgrades to be honest.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998163283,23-Apr-24
Roblox,I used to play it more when I was much younger  Roblox is great for young kids  they have tuns of different games. There's a few glitches there and then and a few hackers or what ever but overall not to bad at all. Edited: Never really used to play this game  but I have fell in love with it again  there is so many different opinions  so many different games to choose from. For example  dress up games  obbys/ parcore  escape  puzzles  random games  plus it's free  overall great app ð,POSITIVE,0,0.98221612,4-Apr-24
Roblox,kind of disappointing  but i still like it. I've been playing this for 4 years. theres some issues that made me give 4 star. first  when you trying to leave. you will rejoin the game if you leave the game (theres a time that the game will automatically join the game for you back). and that bug is kind of annoying. especially for mobile users. and  the robux issue. i dont like to bring this up but the items suddenly become overpriced. the avatar appearance in the game too. it only will be grey.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997886956,8-Mar-24
Roblox,i love this game put the recent updates to the home page makes me not want to play it. it was amazing the way it was before and it was convenient. now its messy and confusing  your friends and continue games are near the bottom of the page  its extremely annoying. not to mention the update for the 3 dots where u access your emotes and the leaderboards move to the other side of the screen  again its confusing and inconvenient. i really hope really hope roblox goes back to the old mechanics.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99782443,13-Apr-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,Recently the app has started giving a lot of bugs. After the free spin  the screen darkens and nothing works. On reopening the app  it starts working again. I have reinstalled the app but the problem persists. Sometimes this happens even after a game. I think it is probably because of loading of ads. They don't load properly and the screen is irresponsive. Please fix this asap!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999593318,20-Mar-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,Card algorithms do not follow statistics. You can easily lose 30 hands in a row and only see a winning hand after you fold. It seems more geared toward pushing the purchase of chips rather than earning them. Because of this inflation no one cares and high bets/all-in is most of the hands. They just implemented a new ad system that makes you get an ad for the same thing 3 times in a row. That's on top of all the new flashy pop-ups they force players through. GG uninstall,NEGATIVE,1,0.997717857,25-Mar-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,it is really hard to play this for fun. I'm not very good at poker but getting into a game where people keep betting all-in just because they can makes it really frustrating because then you have to fold every hand and you can't play also it seems to give people when after when after when after when continuously but it's never your turn to win.... it's okay to fart around on but there are much better games.,NEGATIVE,1,0.957409084,6-Mar-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,Let me give you a class in app design: if your terrible app is going to force me through a long sequence of tutorials before giving me the chance of disabling the sound in the menu  not even letting me do so in the middle of it  I won't get through said tutorial before uninstalling it  as I just did. If I could  I'd give it 0 stars. I never comment here  but this one bothered me beyond measure!,NEGATIVE,1,0.986888647,25-Mar-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,The hands ranking is broken; and some people are clearly cheating and playing 2 accounts simultaneously at the same table  they raise on one account and then leave the table and win on the other. I also have played 30+ hands in a row and gotten nothing that matches up; not worth the annoyance to play this game. I'm uninstalling this game until it gets fixed. âï¸,NEGATIVE,1,0.999577582,27-Apr-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,The game is good overall  however  it's frustrating when glitches happen. Sometimes the cards show that you win and the hand it wins with  then boom  the pot is given to someone else who did not have the winning cards. At first  I thought I missed something  and it happened a second time. I tried to take a screenshot but moved too slow. If you're passing time cool  if you're looking for that hype  don't get too invested.,NEGATIVE,1,0.964439392,28-Mar-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,Garbage app with an awful algorithm designed to make you lose chips in an attempt to make you buy them. The ads are obnoxious and excessive and I actively hate anything that is advertised because of this. There seems to be many instances of bots and cheaters and way too many jackasses that go all in every hand for no reason. This app is truly awful and needs a complete overhaul.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999792993,27-Mar-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,Ive been playing this game for some years now  on and off. I'm back playing again. It is  tho  my preferred LIVE poker game at the moment. My biggest issue is the ADs for free chips-most FOCRE u to click to proceed  causing u to leave the app and go to play store. I wish the diff in the 2watches u get tÃ³ choose from at the end of the challenge were better than just a slight color change like silver vs gold. I do wish u could privately chat w a player while ur at the table.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998712063,19-Feb-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,I had earlier given it 5 star but recently it has started bloatware on a major scale. I'm shown an ad when I open the app  if I come out of lobby  again and ad....if you accidentally click on the spin option..again and ad.... Worst part is these idiots don't have ads to show as when the ad pop up comes it keeps loading and 5 out of 10 times they make you watch blank screen for 30 -40 seconds. Pathetic and worst,NEGATIVE,1,0.999751151,30-Mar-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,Update. Worse than before. I can play 15 to 20 hands with no wins..no longer purchase. Same hand 2x in row.Often I have loved this game for years but latest version has changed everything. Advertising is forced at every turn and the more you win the higher stakes...also forced go larger amounts so that you lose big time and must BUY more chips to play at the higher level pots. Rigging the game in favor of Zynga profits at every turn. There is no end to corporate greed. Not even in  free  games.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996584773,20-Mar-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,Its ok but very frustrating seems that the game just favours some players and other not so much  feels fixed at times. also trying to search for a friend is impossible even when you are friends with the on facebook and have your account linked,NEGATIVE,1,0.775426626,21-Apr-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,Never came across a poker app so rigged  despite all the floors I download it after deleting within few months because at first you win 90% of hands then once it as your feet back under table it is all down hill from there! Unsure why but when you win hands what ever is in the pot should be your winnings but for some unknown reason you take a percentage of the chips away. Very unrealistic and frustrating. Even when the setting for what hands beat what is inactive,NEGATIVE,1,0.997398734,14-Apr-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,Many issues: - Adding and playing with friends is almost impossible (you'll see) - Rerolling a challenge frequently gives you the same challenge - Start off watching Ads for chips then they take those away and make you watch Ads for nothing - Challenges in season pass adapt to your current money to force you into betting brackets you can't afford. You then can't complete challenges and won't finish the pass without buying more chips - You lose money for no reason in a tie Type limit but I'm out,NEGATIVE,1,0.997798502,1-Apr-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,I've recorded 100s of hrs on this site to prove zynga is the one who is using AI to cheat. I was successful. It's a good thing I've never paid for chips or there would be a problem. Feel free to play  but know the outcome is determined based on your play. Anything electronic is not random. Random itself means that it's not random  when it comes to computer algorithms. Zynga does  in fact  cheat.,POSITIVE,0,0.779815733,18-Apr-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,Awful.

Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,The game itself is fine but hampered by poor decisions and updates. The latest one has broken the game.

The ad however will never load  essentially crashing the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998494267,31-Mar-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,Been playing for several years and built up chips. Then overnight  I could only access very pricy games. I lost most of my chips within 5 games  and instead of reducing the buy in  they stayed the same. Then a few months ago the game started to hand on me and I experienced r e a l l y slow connections and the game would hang (especially when I had a good hand) and I would get booted out. I've stopped playing Zynga  it's just too frustrating.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999283493,21-Feb-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,Been playing the game for years  now it's two to three ads before I get to the game itself  now I click on   get what I can  and leave irritated.

Rediculous.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999152184,26-Mar-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,This is a completely rigged game with no true RNG... confirmed by a former developer. There are far too many 1 in a million type hands that bait you into pots in order to drive chip purchases. I wish there was a true poker game on the market  but this one certainly isn't it. I would stay away if you're looking for an actual poker experience. Otherwise take everything with a grain of salt and realize the outcome will change based on other algorithms. Good interface  though.,NEGATIVE,1,0.968583047,18-Mar-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,Getting worse. Used to be an enjoyable game but now it's more and more in having to buy this and buy that   this combined with the very random hands that win in the games along with tip the dealer con and a percentage of all winnings being taken this along with too many bots playing and ruining it for genuine players . Game is a really bad algorithm for players . Wouldnt recommend Giving up and permanently deleting . Algorithm is ridiculous.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999712288,9-Mar-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,Coming from someone who has billions  This game is completely rigged. You can go a whole night without winning a single hand. There's no RNG when it comes to this game.Anyone new playing the game  Here's some advice: Always raise pre-flop. It'll definitely give you the win most of the time. If you have pockets  It's most likely either the board is going to show a pair or someone else has pockets as well. When you fold  It's most likely the game is going to show you you could have won.,NEGATIVE,1,0.97950989,23-Feb-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,I really don't understand why a game with free chips needs to skim SO MUCH from pots. Just had a split pot of 5M and we both ended up with LESS than what we played.

Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,Go into this knowing it is rigged. The game is rigged  pure and simple. If you know this upfront  you'll not be so mad when you end up on an endless losing streak in a bit to make you buy more chips. Because you're not playing for real money  there are plenty of players that just go all in on every hand. This truly ruins the experience as it just isn't a real betting strategy. If you find these players  simply move to another table. Reporting does nothing as theyre playing the game their way.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999786198,14-Apr-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,My ratings will remain at 3 stars. If you want a 5 star rating you'll have to bring back oldest version of this game. I was the best version of Zinga Poker. There were so many cities and rooms that i would occassionally run into some of my friends from FB at certain tables. The new or current version is ok but I feel like some of the people I'm playing against aren't even real people. Some of them seem like  Bots  or A. I. generated.

Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,Site is full of bots and statistically  it favours these bots  and you can play through over 100 hands and lose  and then randomly  when you do get a good hand  the bot just folds without even betting. That is the most suspicious. I recommend playing for fun  but under NO CIRCUMSTANCES buy any chips as it will conspire for you to lose them in dubious ways.,POSITIVE,0,0.862852037,13-Feb-24
Zynga Poker â¢ â Texas Holdem,What a joke this game has become. They must be using the bidenflation scheme. 20 30 50 million chips just for watching an ad? It's a joke.

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,Standard kingdom builder game. Without purchases you'll never be competitive. With a little money and a good alliance you can do ok. The game itself is probably worth 3 stars  but customer service knocks it down to 1. I've had a couple issues with purchases and one issue with an event. Customer service takes forever to respond  closes the issue when you don't respond right away  and is essentially a waste of time because they did nothing to change anything.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998700738,18-Mar-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,Interactions have a lot of bugs. Been the same thing for a long time. Been playing the game for years now and the bugs are the same. Images do not disappear at the same time when you close tab. You can attack people without the war frenzy even popping up despite not even turning it off. Events randomly disappear and the return is just SMALL COMPENSATION! The game is good  top of the line against any of its competitors but THE BUGS NEED TO BE FIXED!,NEGATIVE,1,0.979155123,20-Mar-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,Good game  good concept  good execution  but there's just one bug that's been annoying me. The notification bug  where  if you use time skips and then log off  it notifies you that the thing finished  but it really wasn't. Obviously  this is only for people who have notifications on  but it really confuses me a lot of the time.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99818182,28-Feb-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,Has been having horrible log in issues the past few months. Get a log in error when you open the game sometime and half to start a new account. Then after going through the tutorial once again if you're lucky it'll let you switch to your old  but that is not always the case even if you have your account linked. I raised it from one star to three because deleting and reinstalling the app fixed the issue  but it should never have been an issue in the first place at least not multiple times,NEGATIVE,1,0.998924315,3-Mar-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,After 6 years of playing the game has evolved very little and becomes so repetitive  working on a fixed cycle of events with very little change. Pay wall has become so great its no fun unless you spend  and spend a lot. To be competitive and to help your kingdom well  you need to sink stupid money every 3 months just to play a game. Greed has got the better of Lilith and they should be ashamed.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99944061,28-Apr-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,I love this game. I have played similar games in the past  but the upgrades always took too long and there wasn't much to do when waiting.

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,Cool game  but there is better. I feel like we have to put in too much effort and don't get enough rewards. Other similar games I've played are more balanced with loot and rewards. In this game it feels like you have to do so much for scraps. This game is your standard city-building strategy game that is heavily pay2win. If you get a good alliance you can do okay but you still will never compete with spenders.,NEGATIVE,1,0.992594302,18-Apr-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,Customer service is horrible. When you try ask anything it always responds either with  Player Support is experiencing higher than normal volume.

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,I enjoyed the overall gameplay  but the thing is that the most important kingdom event which is kvk  always conflicts on my time in the Philippines if they can create a set of server dedicated to asia might fix the problem  I don't know if they had a system for that. Its just that everytime I try to go back I only see the time conflict of time that's why I always missed events and even participate to my alliance events.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998171926,18-Apr-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,It's fun  well designed and built game.

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,I have few things to say. 1. I hope you make it easier for us to track who is online and who's not. Like putting a last online or something. 2.

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,Don't fall for the Google Awards program. I claimed them and support asked for proof of both level 2 and purchase. Next  they thanked for the prints but said I reached level 2 faster than usual  and for purchase  I would need to open a set apart claim. The rules are: reach all levels in 30 days  that will never be rewarded! If lvl2 in 5 days is fast  lvl 5 is never gonna happen.

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,Very good game but so much lag during war this is only bad thing. Lilith needs to improve this thing as soon as possible because my friends leave this game only for lagging.

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,I'll be honest. The beginning of the game is exciting. Everything is great. But when I've been playing for about 50 days  usually conquer LOST TEMPLE around that time. A king from another clan shows up and dictates the rules and then the game becomes a nightmare  BORING  no fighting  no action. I don't even want to spend money (if I knew before)ð¤£ I think game publishers should mention something   a lot of people stop playing because they get really bored. I was playing for fun  but today last,NEGATIVE,1,0.996305227,20-Mar-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,It's a great game that becomes boring. Not much to do but same thing over and over. Gets really boring when you have to wait so long for things to level up  what was taking minutes and hours  now takes days and weeks which will become a month. There are items you really need but aren't that easily obtained. The items you do get are useless. So basically if you don't have deep pockets full of money  you are getting no where playing this game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999533772,2-Mar-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,It's a fun time waster but it can be very unfair. You can play for 6 months only for a heavy spender to have an arguement with alliance leadership and they decide to go rogue and wipe out all the smaller players who are offline. I think more should be done to protect players who are offline. I'm never tempted to spend as you're always just a moment away from losing everything due to someone having a bad day.,NEGATIVE,1,0.989532948,19-Mar-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,The game has many recurring bugs  having to reload over and over again when the screen goes awry.

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,I love this game but the games communication skills sucks. Multiple rewards I have missed out on because of there bad communication skills. As well as the overloading amount of p2w players that just overwhelm anyone trying to start a alliance. So if your f2p this game is not for you. This game is also gets VERY boring. You basically do the same thing every day and expect different outcomes. So if you don't have the money stay clear. Wish I downloaded something else.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999653697,13-Mar-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,App's broken!!! Can't play from any android device and stuck at verify! The customer support portal not loading either! This is good bye then.

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,Started this game and had a blast playing until the head of my kingdom decided to make it a Vietnamese only server and started requiring everyone who isn't from Vietnam to emmigrate or their account would be zeroed.

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,Awesome game. Very addictive. Have friends join you. Pick kingdom wisely. Some people over spend and theres no cap. The big flaw of the game.

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,Don't bother. They made this game for mobile devices but as soon as they got the PC version running they stopped carring about mobile devices. If you're not a super whale then you won't even make an impact on the game at this point either; old accounts are so far ahead. The support team might as well be bots that read through a script. They don't fix bugs and every update breaks the game more. The in game support tells you there are bugs and they won't fix it and that they hope you understand.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996432543,30-Mar-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,I love this game! It is super fun. However  it is a bit confusing in some areas. It took me a long time to figure out how to upgrade my generals and how to use them properly. The directions are long winded and confusing. Also I had to fish to find out how to level my city power up. Some of the other players in the chat helped with that! And the time for upgrades increases rapidly! There is no gentle incline  it simply leaps from a couple of hours to days! And the speedups are expensive! ð©ð©,NEGATIVE,1,0.987471759,20-Jan-24

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,good game but the the wait times are bad it would be okay though if barbarians drooped bigger speed boosts or more gems and it takes to much time for higher level barbarians to spawn and they should get rid of action points and just let people play as much as they want or at least let people watch adds to get more action points,NEGATIVE,1,0.998466134,20-Apr-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,Great game. But it could be better. Firstly  it takes way too long ( like absurdity) to upgrade your city and troops. Also  it is difficult for new players to advance quickly enough unless they are in an alliance. The reason is that the higher level of players tend to go for the lowest ones resources first. The add-ons are also quite expensive. Also  please give an option to delete your characters because  at the moment  the only option is to delete the entire account.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999209881,28-Jan-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,Was a good game couple of years ago but now it's completely UNPLAYABLE. New server  and by new i mean 3 minutes old  and some people already with 1 million power. There is the possibility to move your city from another server plus people here spend money like nowhere make it a useless game for new people or for who doesn't have a big spending habit.

They constantly create new gimmicks to get you to pay to keep up with the power of P2W players. You spend a year upgrading one general only to have them useless because new ones come out.

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,It is a fun game and really good to pass time  but I have one thing that I do slightly think is very annoying  you can't play with friends if they did not start on your server until you reach town hall level 16 which will take a lot of time as of now I'm on hall level 11 so I cannot play with my friends,NEGATIVE,1,0.985741854,18-Mar-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,Honestly I was going to give this a 5 star  but your ads are ruining the experience. Most of them are false advertisements and don't actually show what the game really is  and I already have it downloaded yet I see multiple rok ads back to back.

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,Hey  developer! Try to play the game of the recent update you made just this March 25  2024. There is a bug in the  Daily Objectives  in which  help allies  stucks in 19/20. It won't give you the rewards from it. I suggest you play the game each time you update it so that you will know if there's something wrong about it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999145865,27-Mar-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,I change my review from 4 to 1  Well  I don't have a problem with the game  I have a problem with the style  that players who spend a lot of money on the game annoyingly mock those who low spend and f2p  no matter how much time you spend playing.

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,I downloaded this game yesterday and the reason for the three stars is my disappointment after seeing Byzantium in the list of empires  and the character speaking latin. The only reason the historians even call the Eastern Roman Empire Byzantium is because of the distinct differences with the previously Roman Empire. For example  the language spoken in Byzantium  a Greek city  was the Hellenic language. Greek was the official language of the empire  not Latin. Devs got caught lacking,NEGATIVE,1,0.999655843,15-Mar-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,I've been playing for over 1200 days now. The game is basically a time filler. KvK is the only fun portion. It takes months to prepare for one 50 day Kingdom vs. Kingdom event. Would be more fun if they offered short burst weekend long tournaments every weekend. It would break up the monotony...,NEGATIVE,1,0.998986423,30-Mar-24

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,It was my favorite online game at one time  but it was ruined by migration. I was in a great kingdom and alliance  which I worked extremely hard to get into  and then all the top players jumped to another lesser kingdom to be more dominant. Then another group migrated  and I was left in a dead kingdom. This happened several times  so after 4 years  I quit cold turkey and never looked back. It takes a lot of time  especially in kvk. If you have tons of free time and some spare cash it's fun.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99776566,4-Feb-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,It's quite good  but the long time or heavily you play the game  bugs would appear. When I was investigating mysterious caves of high or medium level  it would only appear as a lvl 1 treasure after I gather it.

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,This game is really the best  I've been playing this game for a year and it's really fun and easy to play  the commander also looks great and there are quite a few civilizations and it's hard to choose which one because all the civilizations are great and my suggestion is you can make more civilization like Malacca Empire,POSITIVE,0,0.999608696,3-Mar-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,I would really like to get the peerless scholar midterm (and probably final) updated to make it easier to participate. The window is so small and often occurs late at night and I basically never am able to participate. And when I do try to participate  half the time something goes wrong with it and it won't let me anyway. The qualifier rounds are super easy to use. Why can't the whole thing work the same way. It's a great part of the game and it's so incredibly annoying that it doesn't work.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999491453,25-Nov-23
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,So far  it's been pretty middle of the road with this game; it's fun  and the gameplay isn't bad. However  it seems like ROK is very P2P  and it doesn't exactly force this down your throat like other games  except you are capable of getting resources  time skips  commanders  et cetera with real money  thus it's P2W. That being said  the F2P experience isn't all that bad early on  at least. It seems like the later you go  the more this becomes a problem. Reducing microtransactions is necessary.,NEGATIVE,1,0.979920566,31-Jan-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,I love this game I couldn't stop playing ever since I downloaded the game I just had nothing to think except this game  but there is a catchy thing in this game and is about how people usually play this game  some people might not join the game for the mean time they are bored I just want to make this game more exciting for new players that play the new game.,POSITIVE,0,0.990309536,28-Apr-24

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,I love the memes and functions of this game  the only thing is that it gives a massive amount of materials and resources from a random thing that can't even possibly actually have in. Although the game is pretty nice however the popularity has dropped so brutal than before. The game is realistic such as mountains and technologies.,NEGATIVE,1,0.845692277,22-Feb-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,Great game  but I paid money and it will not let me keep playing. Gives you a button to press verification and then goes to a broken pop up saying web page bad.

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,Was good until they made it so I can't have 2 of my best generals come back home.

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,I played since 2021  and made a review about a year later saying how great the game was. The game itself is fine  it's just so pay to win you can't even keep up anymore without spending money. I have quit and will never come back because of this and it has ruined the game. It would be sooooo much more fun if free to play players stood a chance,NEGATIVE,1,0.552865684,25-Jan-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,Been playing for years. Almost from the start and has become increasingly P2W. The game is still great and addictive bit does require money to get the best out of it. My advice to any new players (F2P) would be to ignore all legendary commanders and save all your gold statues until SoC (season 4) as even YSG is basically not great after season 3. There is a museum building used to increase these early game commanders but not enough.,NEGATIVE,1,0.92318368,21-Jan-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,I think this is one of the best games it's really fun and you can make friends the only downside is how long it takes to develop your city and it becomes pay to win once you use your materials,POSITIVE,0,0.998945534,20-Mar-24

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,I really really love this game! The storyline is engaging the battles fun. Yet MAN does this game tend to take long to load! And building up your city takes long when you do not wanne spend real money on gems to buy speedups. Sure there are ways in the game to come by gems but still need to wait a full day somethimes before buildings are upgraded. Keep building on this game. I'll make sure to keep playing if you do.,POSITIVE,0,0.998433053,7-Feb-24

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,I actually really enjoy this game  but the one massive issue I have are the  Whales.  Being a free to play player  it's such a nuisance to have these players come in a basically pay to win. I really wish the developers would just make separate servers for the free to play players or at least make a limit to their spending on a server. This way  these players can spend their cash and do whatever rich people do and leave the free to play players to have fun together.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998876631,24-Feb-24

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,Rise of Kingdoms is a massively expansive mobile game that allows you to play according to your preferred style. Whether you're drawn to bold military ventures and dreams of global dominance  or prefer a more discreet approach focusing on statecraft and creating a contented populace  this game caters to a variety of playstyles.

You'll have the chance to interact,POSITIVE,0,0.999463022,12-Feb-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,Really good game  lots to do. The only reason why only a 4 star is due to the length of time it takes to up grade things at such an early level. Makes the game a lot harder than it needs to be unless you buy things. I am not one to buy things to upgrade as I am a true believer in doing it the true game way. This needs to looked at.,NEGATIVE,1,0.975743592,17-Feb-24

Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,It's a fun game easy early game  but when you get to city hall 18 and up you have to spend money to improve your city  and the troops training time gets outrageously high  not to mention the 59 day research time  please balance the game and make it easier to progress for new players.,POSITIVE,0,0.998503685,4-Feb-24
Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade,Been playing for just over 3 years. Game takes a he'll of a lot of commitment and time but it's fun and developer are always trying to implement things. It's a little stale in the off season but this gives you time to prepare. You need to be a low spender in order to keep up with the whales.

AFK Arena,There's no fuss about diamonds or currency  if you keep playing you can get even the rare drops. And the best thing - it's not compulsory to pay to advance further in the game. I've been playing it consecutively for about 5 hours. I agree that it crashes on iPhone but somehow it works fine on android systems. All in all its a wonderful game! The detailing of each heroes story and character and fights - I'm surprised it's not blown up. Loved it!,POSITIVE,0,0.998435676,5-Apr-20
AFK Arena,Problem is solved!! I love the game in general  some of the characters designs I ADORE COMPLETELY. Some  I do not like but it is in my opinion  the skins and/or costumes for some of the heroes are gorgeous  the free rewards  diamonds  skins  etc  is a greatly appreciated amount. Some of the voice acting is spot on the characters  some are not equally as spot on  but either way  there is nice voice acting and stories!!!

AFK Arena,So far  the game is good. The beginning tutorial and section until you get to go free and do what you want is VERY rushed it seemed to me. The graphics are nice and the hero banter is colorful. The only thing that doesn't work for me is the secret invasion section. I can't get past the part where you hero says they'll attack automatically. The game freezes and I need to restart it and im then stuck in an infinite loop.

AFK Arena,This is one of the few mobile games that I've had a good experience with. It has interesting characters and stories (provided that you're ok with some reading--which I am)  and a nice sense of progression. It introduces new features at a reasonable pace  and the mechanics and in-game currency are both relatively intuitive--not overwhelming at all. Plus  your characters continue to progress  even as you explore the menus. It's a nice game for those looking for a light  casual fantasy RPG.,POSITIVE,0,0.999714673,30-Mar-24
AFK Arena,It's a great game well made and fun. The major problem I have is it's really easy to make a lot of progress and then get bottle necked for a while. Those bottle necks can last for a while with zero progress then you get lucky and it ends being able to push further till you meet another bottleneck or get bored. At least that's my experience. That's the only reason it did not get a five other than that it's a truley great game.,POSITIVE,0,0.998269081,24-Apr-24
AFK Arena,As you go onto higher chapters  the less fun you'll have since you're more likely to get stuck at every levels(especially for f2p players) if you don't play smart and build meta teams from the beginning  which is a disadvantage for new players. Even with good events  you'll still end up having a hard time ascending your heroes and being low to mid-pay to-progress player won't give you much since the game is more designed towards big spenders. But it's still fun and enjoyable to play overall.,POSITIVE,0,0.994929552,7-Apr-24
AFK Arena,I get that games are made to make money  but from a totally fine paying to advance faster it is turning into a pay to win game by every major update since introducing beasts.

Overall a well polished game.,POSITIVE,0,0.999269903,11-Mar-24
AFK Arena,Playing and keeping up with this game became a matter of spending money endlessly  and stopped being funny  new stuff all the time  you must spend money or you'll loose your progress  even though they do give free stuff   became a game for those who throw away their money and that's okay if you have that type of money. This is my new review after 5 years playing. And at the end  I can't even change the email address I've signed up with because the developers refused to do it for me.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998924196,17-Mar-24

That and the intro to the game are the reasons I'm not giving 5 stars  so  it seems like a very good game!,POSITIVE,0,0.999337494,20-Apr-24
AFK Arena,Despite a restart on my account  the recent event that has been going on as well as overall quality improvements to the game itself have really made my opinion of those game gone back up into more favorable territory. Definitely one of the better crafted and looking AFK games out there.,POSITIVE,0,0.996716022,27-Apr-24
AFK Arena,Beware the new event. At the end of the battered ruins quest you are scripted to lose all of your equipped heroes just so Gwyneth can swoop down and destroy every enemy except the boss. And you cannot use Dura's Tears to revive. And the game constantly lags and crashes as well during the gameplay.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999624729,27-Apr-24
AFK Arena,I really like this game! Many of the characters here are simpable. Especially Oden  Hildwin  Eugene and his boyfriend Gavus. The only ever thing that bothers me are the restrictions this game has  by that I mean that certain stuff like stargazing and whatnot requires you to have unlocked many parts of the campaign. Though that's just the one thing that annoys me but overall  this game is cool.,POSITIVE,0,0.998140812,23-Apr-24
AFK Arena,I had my stars to all 5 because of how fun the game is I was playing the game a few months ago upgrading my heroes and and continuing the game. Then today I check in on my game to find that a majority of my characters and game progress is missing and changed. I'm not sure if I'm the only one with this issue I saw the new updates but what happened to my characters I had so many that I don't think I'll be able to get back without going through the grind for them again. Can someone help please.,NEGATIVE,1,0.969454706,26-Apr-24
AFK Arena,I like it ! It's a real fun game and super easy just to pick up whenever  definitely easy to level up your characterz right off the bat. Only reason I didn't give it five stars because even with a good connection and free space the games a little laggy,POSITIVE,0,0.656776667,18-Apr-24
AFK Arena,I just downloaded it and I've already spent hours playing this game. The currencies in this game is not that hard to obtain not like any other games out there. Not much ads and I like the graphics and the gameplay. 4 stars  could improve more.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998235583,27-Apr-24
AFK Arena,Unable to launch game now...new update killed itI'm on chapter 39  and have not paid a dime for anything. This game is not p2w . You added the ability to participate as a viewer in the new event  meaning that players who can't join  can still get rewards...nice going.(not sarcasm). Keep up the good work!

AFK Arena,Unplayable. Terrible system performance. It has loading screen to view the menu. Every click on the interface has a lag. Using latest Samsung device.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999510407,22-Apr-24
AFK Arena,Was good but the new dragon faction is absurd. A whole new summoning system with two new card summon only characters  five regular characters that need their own scrolls so the usual scrolls are useless  a mediocre game mode that requires the new dragon faction to succeed  and a new resonating crystal just for the dragons. To top it all off trying to use diamonds to get anything for the dragon faction is so bad 500 diamonds for 2 emblems. This update is terrible  don't bother installing now,NEGATIVE,1,0.99930656,24-Apr-24
AFK Arena,I've been playing this game for a solid year and a half it's honestly really good. Some say there's a certain point when it becomes pay to win  but that's not necessarily true. I've seen people have incredible progress on the game without spending a single cent. But it requires patience and know what modes give the rewards and resources you need. Overall I'm pretty happy with the game,POSITIVE,0,0.999737799,24-Feb-24
AFK Arena,ABSOLUTELY one of the best games I played so far. Besides Skullgirls  its honestly not stressing to grind and to get pulls unlike other games. The graphics are honestly super  SUPER! Good. The artstyle of this game absolutely has me in awe  the gameplay is definitely relaxitng too! It's not too grindy and I've been playing for abou a year now. Or more since I usually quit in between because of school  its a chill game  a solid 10/10 for me with a cherry on top.,POSITIVE,0,0.999673843,1-Apr-24
AFK Arena,Decided to come back after a little break and found all of my characters and stats reset  even when I had quite a few decent leveled heroes. But guess this goes to the bin now after the game itself has deleted my progress (even signed into Google) good GB saver then but slightly annoying.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999526381,14-Apr-24
AFK Arena,They have really good characters and some of the back stories are amazing. some even made me cry. it's impossible to run out of stuff to do and it's easy to get gems and hero's. it's also fun to race against friends to get better hero's then them or one particular hero. 10/10 recommend. ð¤,POSITIVE,0,0.999616385,14-Apr-24
AFK Arena,Everything was fine at first I was unlocking different chapters  obtaining great characters until I started lagging every time I unlock a new chapter it was bearable at first until now I'm at chapter 16-1.. I lag so much that the game starts crashing and kicks me out the app.. I thought at first it was my storage. It wasn't that I deleted the data and cash still didn't work I went to your help bot still couldn't help and now I don't even anymore..please fix this cause I do love this game..,NEGATIVE,1,0.990380168,9-Mar-24
AFK Arena,I actually love this game!!! I don't think there is anything wrong with it. it's so very well balanced and there's a fair amount of characters to collect and you can level them up soooooo muuuuch!! absolutely in love with the art style and the voice acting for the characters are on point which isn't really needed or asked for from a game like this back they hands down NAILED IT! amazing game 6/10. Changed my mind progress grindss too a SUPER SLOW hault. Stopped me from playing  too slow,POSITIVE,0,0.997840166,28-Mar-24
AFK Arena,Devs please read. Awesome game But reason I don't give 5 stars is because of the labyrinth. From what info I gathered  the labyrinth takes teams from different players with the same level a you. But some of these team are not balanced at all. Such as having a single hero being overlevel (level 140 for example) and the rest of the team is all level 1. This means that the balanced team of hero I created which all have normaly leveled heros (heros equaly level) can't do nothing against the one hero,NEGATIVE,1,0.983697355,15-Apr-24
AFK Arena,The game  stories and hero display is pretty good  but I have been playing this game for more than 3 years and there is still no update on the loading things. It takes way to long  and right now  I can't even login  please fix this issue as fast as you can,NEGATIVE,1,0.996980965,25-Apr-24
AFK Arena,This game I've played it for 2 years and all of a sudden after I return to find out my Google play account does not work and or allow me to continuous progress. I had to restart again on a new account back on level 1. So be aware that if you are gone for a couple months that you might lose everything that you paid or earned through this game. And there's nothing to help you recover from the painful lost.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999751866,1-Apr-24
AFK Arena,very good game so far!! I find it fun and I love the heroes  nice quality  good graphics and time consuming in a good way. Passes by time and really easy to level up and the quest help you so much for good stuff like coins and vip points and other things. so far so good!!,POSITIVE,0,0.999875903,14-Apr-24
AFK Arena,Good game for a gatcha game  but after the recent update it won't stop saying loading while also saying to tap on something and any time I try to tap on it it won't work. I'm afraid to reinstall as I may not get my safe file back and I won't be able to access my progress,NEGATIVE,1,0.995348513,27-Apr-24
AFK Arena,One of those great at first  immensely frustrating later games. If you lose the rng on hero draws  you either spend money or get stuck for ages. Another review mentioned how obnoxious farming duplicate heroes is to upgrade existing ones and that's spot on. I came back to this game three times and always left frustrated. Having said that  the art style is commendable and if you get lucky the game will entertain you for a good while till the inevitable difficulty paywall.,NEGATIVE,1,0.739273489,18-Feb-24
AFK Arena,Fun game  I enjoy the hero collector aspect and that there are plenty of ways to play. You don't have to play pvp or any of the dungeons if you don't want to  and there are lots of other minigames within the game that keep it interesting. Getting a hang of heroes and their abilities is something you pick up along the way  and the community is pretty active in its discussions.,POSITIVE,0,0.99945873,7-Mar-24
AFK Arena,I have been an avid player for quite a few years now. While I enjoyed playing AFK Arena  it has become increasingly time-consuming due to the new features that tend to be added during that time. At this point  I wish for a means of auto-playing the game that would allow me to finish everything in a matter of minutes while also successfully using the excess resources I gained with ease. Overall  it is still enjoyable to play  but it is no longer the child prodigy I met in my youth.,POSITIVE,0,0.990605772,10-Mar-24
AFK Arena,Honestly  I don't play many mobile games. I did see ads for this all over my social media  but after seeing Markiplier's trailer I was sold. It actually is immediately addicting and I just love the art  the character designs  all of the activities there are to do (so you're never bored)  and overall I really appreciate a game that isnt pay-to-win and it's really easy to earn in game currency daily. I love it!!!,POSITIVE,0,0.999623656,15-Mar-24
AFK Arena,Awesome game!! I had a big issue with one of the updates that was a potential security risk by moving the redeem code from the game to a link website. anyways its a optional feature now that I will not use. Still can't believe it's been 3+years and I'm still playing this game.... still a awesome game and it got even better with a lot of updates to better the game. 10 5stars ð,POSITIVE,0,0.994378626,19-Feb-24
AFK Arena,Truly an absolute master piece sent from the gods above. This silly little game has cost me not a DIME to play fairly and the balance of the game makes me want to burst into tears of joy. The cut scenes make me ascend to ungodly levels with my soul being cleansed every.single.time. I have played this game for hours on end and I never get bored. Charater designs? Perfect. Lore? Makes me want to vomit and cry with tears of agony and joy. 11/-69 would recommend,POSITIVE,0,0.998871744,18-Feb-24
AFK Arena,Great game that is easy to play. It has very fun yet simple combat. Overall  the game deserves 5 stars the only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because your heroes rely on luck I would enjoy it alot more if they implemented a system to earn heroes through tough exilerating arena. If I could  I would rate it a 4.9,POSITIVE,0,0.9987275,12-Mar-24
AFK Arena,Love this game  sure you can get stuck on levels sometimes  but it's fairly easy to level up your heroes and fix that. The heroes' lore is interesting and the character designs are amazing!ð,POSITIVE,0,0.999849916,17-Feb-24
AFK Arena,Definitely a learning curve but overall pretty fun. One less star because there is always something to do  that is until you are completely capped out and unless you spend money have to just wait for the daily.,POSITIVE,0,0.997989058,27-Mar-24
AFK Arena,it's an idle heroes rip off but it's fun and the combat system is enjoyable. the learning curve isn't difficult at all but I wish there were more hypogeans to use. I love how focusing all your time on a single team doesn't hurt you in the long run because you have a way to scale other heroes to your strongest five plus if you decide you don't want to use a hero you can take their experience and put it on another hero.,POSITIVE,0,0.999480903,21-Feb-24
AFK Arena,I've been playing this game for over a month now and I'm absolutely loving it. Having daily tasks to come back to  even if you're stuck on a level gives a nice steady pace. I enjoy all the gameplay options. The art style is awesome  in my opinion the best out of all of this genre. The heroes all feel unique both in looks and in mechanics - really loving the recent new addictions! I'm not one to spend money on a game but I have to admit I've thrown a bit of dosh at this game through enjoyment,POSITIVE,0,0.999687672,24-Feb-24
AFK Arena,I've actually played this game for 2 years now and  I kid you not  its part of my daily routine. amazing graphics  fun and easy to play. amazing rewards and as someone who plays games like this for a little relaxation and to actually just enjoy  I can fully give it a well deserved 5 stars.,POSITIVE,0,0.999856234,25-Mar-24
AFK Arena,The game is designed for whales(rich ppl).For the rest is like the more you play the more you get punished. The game progress is like this: at start you progress everyday  later on every week  after that every month and later at best you might have some progress every 2-3 months or be like 5+ without good progress(champion pulls). If you want a game that's punishing you the more you play  well give it a shot. Games like this prove me right to not like mobile games,NEGATIVE,1,0.988975406,29-Feb-24
AFK Arena,They don't let you delete the account at your own free will. They expect you to dig through years of purchases and surrender receipts that are not found years later. I have no time to play some silly Easter egg hunt for my purchases.I want my account closes permanently. I do not want to delete the app and come back later I'm done with you vampires. Delete my account. Scum.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999198854,16-Feb-24

AFK Arena,Update: I have been playing for a time now  2 months maybe  and let me tell you  i love the developers of this game  the give so much fo free  and if the game has a problem or something  they give you free gems  for every maintenience  every update or every hotfix  it hard to find devs that Care that much for the game and its community  im sad I cant give this game more than 5 stars.,POSITIVE,0,0.574520111,30-Mar-24
AFK Arena,It is a very good game but I have a idea. For the people who doesn't do King's Tower much  could you make an option for it to quick clear to go up to the level your people would bring you to?,POSITIVE,0,0.760553479,15-Feb-24

AFK Arena,Decent character designs  nicely done art  and amazing backgrounds. It's very  very easy to get stuck though  to the point where you just can't progress. One really annoying thing is that the game will sometimes crash on me out of nowhere  for no reason. The ui layout for the game is very confusing and I got stuck on multiple occasions  but overall  pretty mid + some of the female characters tatas seem to have been the main focus for a lot of them so uh maybe tone it down a bit?,NEGATIVE,1,0.993537009,4-Jan-24
AFK Arena,Started well and it's still a pretty interesting and well rounded game. Last review I had an issue with their winter upgrade  but they fixed it and kept the game running smooth since then. I only wish they would improve the odds of getting more purple heroes. Those faction scrolls still give you cheap heroes  so what's the point in spending diamonds to get irrelevant rewards?,POSITIVE,0,0.997899771,22-Dec-23
AFK Arena,Has become harder to get a team up above level 140. Just so many options you don't get the copies you need  over time obviously you grow. It just becomes frustrating hence why can't say 5 stars,NEGATIVE,1,0.999567568,25-Apr-24
AFK Arena,So far the game has my attention and I'm about 4hrs in on gameplay! Artwork is great and I have a lower end phone with no crashes so far. 10 out of 10 would recommend so far.,POSITIVE,0,0.996920347,27-Apr-24
AFK Arena,I have been avoiding this game due to the fact that my phone is very low in capacity and RAM  yes I have been hesitant but on the latter part I still did and dang I don't regret anything! This game is fun and it just works for my phone very smoothly. (If I bought a new phone soon  I will surely download this game first),POSITIVE,0,0.997799575,25-Apr-24
AFK Arena,Gets worse with every update. There is SO MUCH dead content in this game  so many useless heroes that have no purpose  no use cases whatsoever. And what do Lilith do? They release unbelievably pay2win heroes  an insane game mode(dragon trials) that only huge whales can even participate in  and NEVER buff existing heroes. Play it if you want a stale metagame that never changes  or if you are ready to open your wallet. This isn't a game for free to play players at all.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999610364,24-Apr-24
AFK Arena,This game is p2w. Once you get to a certain level you basically can't progress without paying  no matter how active you are. I loved it in the beginning but after spending so many hours on this game I'm just disappointed.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999144912,24-Apr-24

AFK Arena,Honestly  a very fun experience once you find yourself a good guild. Starting the game is a lot more intimidating due to the sheer content you're faced with  but once you've established yourself (after about a week) the grind lessens considerably and it becomes a proper afk game. The events are fun  the artstyle is gorgeous and it's cool how each character has their own story and relationship dynamics with other characters  all of which can be found in the library or on their portrait. 10/10!,POSITIVE,0,0.999793351,2-Jan-24
AFK Arena,I just started playing afk and I enjoy it so much. Its really fun and addicting. Although I do wish we could get more amounts of material to level up our hero's.

AFK Arena,Ive played this game for years. Im pretty far into it the campaign. Never spent a dime and there are ZERO ads. In the beginning you will be able to play alot but you WILL get to a point where it slows down alot and you will just play for about 10 minutes per day to do the daily quests. This game is for people who enjoy the grind. There is a LOT of depth to the advancement of the strength of your characters.

AFK Arena,I used to play the game a lot but it's slowly becoming repetitive and boring  so I rarely started to check the game and then the constant releases of new heroes you can't keep up. It used to be fun but now not so much.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999058664,13-Mar-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,Even 10 stars are not enough for this game. I love it so much and been playing it from it's early days. Only problem is  after recent updates it started happening that when I play for a while  like 2 or 3 matches... the joystick/directional controller on the left gets stuck completely until I turn off my screen and turn it on again. It's probably some kind of a memory issue because I'm using Huawei Y9 Prime 2019. And it feels like by turning screen off and on  the GC deallocates some memory.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994872272,1-Mar-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,Having played eFootball (PES FOOTBALL ) for 3-4 years  I can confidently say I'm addicted to this game.

eFootballâ¢ 2024,This game had so much potential. The controls felt good  the visuals were decent  but all that gets thrown out the window the second you step online. Lag. It's not a bug  it's a feature. My internet connection could stream 4K movies with no hiccups  but eFootball Mobile turns every match into a slideshow. Players warp around the field  button presses register a beat later  and forget about any online tactics â it's pure  unplayable chaos.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998600185,26-Apr-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,This is the best football game alive but it will be more fun if u add a feature where we can see the score and assist leaderboard. that's all for now why is it so hard to win the league when playing superstar level even when it's seem easy from the start   all of a sudden a team that's 20 on the table will beat u 3-0 it's just so annoying it's seem to me that it's cheat ð­ at times when I want to make a pass or shoot the ball the controls will fail to work which does not happen on a normal day,NEGATIVE,1,0.995357573,28-Apr-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,The graphics is excellent and smooth but there are still problems/glitch in the gameplay. When im defending  my players react so slow and dont mark the opponents. Dribbling is terrible in the new update. Sometimes the whistle is blown for offside but the player is not even offside in the replay(this happens quite alot). The chances of scoring free kick is very low. You cant even shoot past the wall unless you do a sky rocket. Golds are also hard to get  its becoming a pay to win game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997542143,18-Apr-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,Not a bad football game anyway. But my problem in the game is that they should make the 1v1 game more smoother when playing  whenever I press the pass button  it takes time for the player to pass the ball. They should also reduce the time it take to connect the 1v1 match... All am saying is that they should make the 1v1 match smooth as when playing vs AI,NEGATIVE,1,0.992955148,29-Apr-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,The game is good but I have a problem with the key matches. They are unnecessary and the opponents players become overrated and the game becomes boring.

Add a feature where you can control the camera when it comes to replays for better .Make the spectators more realistic,NEGATIVE,1,0.999421477,19-Apr-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,Optimize the game more. Cursor change is still a problem as it does not switch to a proper player. Efootball points are no longer useful  gamers are forced to exchange them for useless players or watch them expire. Players are sometimes heavy to control when using match up. Stunning shots and Stunning passes are heavy  they sometimes take extremely more time to perform.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998802781,25-Apr-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,It is one of the best football games however  players should be completely out not less than 5 seconds when injured. Need to be a little more realistic. The recent update has removed how the login bonus works  so now club coins are so hard to get.Secondly  in event mode the event rewards are useless after completing it. Beside these it is one of the best games I have played.

eFootballâ¢ 2024,This is a very good game ð¯ the graphics  game play and controls are realistic but how come the referee is invisible during regular play and only appears during fouls or set-peice  and also I hope that you guys can add some kind of dribbling control for skillful players to explore their dribbling potentials because using just the analog stick is very inefficient.

eFootballâ¢ 2024,The graphics and playing methods are perfect but the competition is not complete which is suppose to be atleast three competitions every seasons but it's just one which is just the league and another thing is that it does not have record for goal scorers assist top performance or even ordinary man of the match in a game.it really needs to improve in this aspect and it would surely be the best soccer game on earth.,NEGATIVE,1,0.761076093,18-Apr-24

eFootballâ¢ 2024,I change my review on this game with the new update came problems  especially the controls  something is wrong  I can't run  it just stops  and it's very bad during attack as I can't control my player to the right direction or run fast  it freezes  and i loose the Ball  Very Frustrating  I can't pass adequately anymore also.

eFootballâ¢ 2024,HELLO KONAMI. Fix the defending  it's really bad especially against AI  it's as of the pressure button is just for decoration. Also  shot rebound is almost impossible in the game now  the players just stop responding. If stunning shot won't be possible due to the time it takes please bring back our double tap shots. Also Konami  Give us league and cup competitions  it gets boring in there. This is still going to be my favorite game  but I believe you guys can do better.

eFootballâ¢ 2024,I have been a dedicated player of this game for a while  but lately  I am feeling really let down. The gameplay clunky   which makes it hard to enjoy a smooth match. It's especially frustrating when I am on the verge of winning  only to have buffering issues ruin my chances. I have noticed this happens only the time of winning. It never happend when I am losing the game..And it's making me wonder if there's a problem with the game itself or if there are just too many hackers causing issues.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999418139,19-Apr-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,It used to be a very good and enjoyable game. Until it started lagging and it's like sometimes your controls freeze out  your players just stand looking on and this normally happens in the crucial areas of the defense or when they are counter attacking you. What's most annoying is that if your game freezes your opponent's is just fine. This has costed us too much and it's very painful and frustrating to lose a game you are winning cause of this. It used to be the best mobile game.Now It's trash,NEGATIVE,1,0.991783023,25-Apr-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024, key match  is the most BS thing ever. I would be in first or second  and then lose to a team in 10th place  just because the difficulty is bumped up by 2 levels. Remove this BS feature  players pick a difficulty because they want to play in it  and they think it matches their skill level  if they wanted the game to be harder  they would make it harder.

eFootballâ¢ 2024,I suspect match fixing in tour events of eFootball  noticing players consistently nerfed while opponents get buffs  even tho their team is very poor  leading to prolonged gameplay. It appears designed to extend playtime globally  leveraging absence of a quit button. But if u close the game  then the quit button will appear ð¤£.

Firstly  the skill set and dribbling controls are extremely poor . The player models were blocky  and the animations were choppy  making it hard to immerse oneself in the gameplay.

eFootballâ¢ 2024,Best football game on mobile right now. I love the features and I am looking forward for more developments like competing for European trophies and also domestic cups during a season. I think we need to see the squad lineup before the game starts.

It seems like those stats don't really matter in the game. Sometimes  a player with a low pass of 60 even gives accurate passes than this Debruyne   Odegaard  etc. Again  the defenders intercept too much making goal scoring very difficult.

eFootballâ¢ 2024,An excellent game of football. To me It's the best football game on phone. However  I think there are some areas to improve. First of all  in league season  you may include top scorer  top assist provider stats. As well as you can include if a player get 5 yellow cards in a season he will miss the next match rule. At the same time  we should also consider stamina of a player in a match as well as in a season.

eFootballâ¢ 2024,The game is good with great graphics and lot more to enjoy  but it does need a little bit of other features like playing competitions like leagues and cups  different stadiums and different weather conditions being able to set time when playing campaign mode so that the matches could go to extra time.Top goal scores and assists  players with top goals for the club.Efootball will be much more good if you add the stadiums of the licensed teams the referee on the pitch,POSITIVE,0,0.984940946,21-Mar-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,Online matches are too difficult to play  you can't play 5 consecutive passes without giving a blind pass or making an error  the player are slow  the passes are slow  they take long to kick the ball  everything is scripted. I play possession football but my players keep on hiding behind opponents  they don't open up. I used to play this game everyday  every time but now I play it once a month only to check whether you have done any improvement but nothing.

eFootballâ¢ 2024,I love almost everything about this game  but this are few things I don't really like. It's very difficult to connect and play with friend [work on multiple player]. also players should be to change night or day in multiple player. There should be more stadium for the game also the there should be different weather conditions to make the game more realistic. I would love it if the game has champions league  just it has plemier league.Regardless this is still the best mobile football game I've pl,POSITIVE,0,0.99879992,8-Apr-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,you people need to do better  it is always like a person is playing against an opponent and against Game itself whenever one is playing e football league. whenever you are about to Qualify all of sudden every thing is against you  your passes doesn't go in the direction intended  the opponent Goal keeper becomes a supper Hero  you start having network issues  you have to tap shoot thrice before it is effected and lot more?? why ??? i am disappointed.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999263346,17-Apr-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,Slow  and bad servers.. full of scripts. Very bad luck when it comes to pack opening.. no interesting or new events  very few to no rewards.. you guys need to solve these problems  or else you're gonna loose all your costumers. Very bad gameplay  such a rubbish work you're doing guys  so many scripts  slow gameplay  full of errors.. disgraceful.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999808729,24-Mar-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,I am very disappointed with the last major updation. After the update my whole players are lost their stamina and energy....they can't run speed....they can't pass the ball to other teammates.. when they are trying to pass the ball every time it goes to opponent playar....they lost the accuracy and the skills in passing  shooting  dribbling  etc......when the play in a attacking mode the rest of the players are going back instead of going towards. ...what a pity.....pls fix this problem. .,NEGATIVE,1,0.999754846,6-Apr-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,I can say due to the recent update I am not really contented with the fixes of various bugs and issues. It feels like the defending is overkill now players body is being bent in unorthodox position especially in Ai events to prevent goals from scoring. At times the Ai tends to unexpectedly turning faster than the players with the ball resulting in lost of possession. It tends to look like the possession of the ball was taken but swap. (Trash) check ratings 1.8 for a reason,NEGATIVE,1,0.999681115,13-Apr-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,The game is very unpleasant in terms of graphics  but in terms of the game is very unpleasant for several reasons: 1. Difficult to earn coins  unlike before  the more divisions you can play  the more money you get But now you are very  very reduced. 2: On Thursdays when the best box of the week arrives  as before  you must have 1 free ticket and one in the event. If these two points are implemented  I think the game will be much better.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999068677,22-Mar-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,The game is an interesting play  but I would like if one can easily get more coins to be able to get better players  because it is harder to increase a league ranking with weaker players  and now the friend matches always get ended unexpectedly New review April  26  2024 The connection problem is annoying  if one connection lags  the opponent will have free reign to play against others  I would prefer it if the match is paused or cancelled to avoid the ease of taking advantage,NEGATIVE,1,0.997843146,26-Apr-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,I loved this game to death. Now  all of a sudden after your updates  the controllers are not in function. I thought initially it was my phone's touch  but there's nothing wrong. I've lost ALL my data because I had to re-download the game  cause I then thought it might be my storage  however  after deleting a lot of files it still does the same damn thing. We're using data to download and to make you rich  but please look after us also. This error has been coming for some time now.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998231947,9-Apr-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,Please add a designated  dash  or sprint button to touch and flick controls. I've had a lot of situations where I'll be dribbling and I'll mistakingly activate a shot by double tapping because of how sensitive my screen is. A dash button would solve this easily. Please do consider this  and our gaming experience will be a better one. And also please make it so that if we make a pass mistakenly instead of a through pass or a lofted one  we can change the input. Classic control can do this easily.,POSITIVE,0,0.55173707,1-Apr-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,Gameplay is alright  I love the graphics but honestly the difficulty levels are unreal. Beginner to top player seems too easy while superstar and legend seems extremely hard  when it's om SS or legend  Ai starts playing like all it's players are on 100  all it's decisions are accurate while yours become faulty. In addition  I hope you introduce a control for skill moves because the skill set of players are useless  seems they're just there to make the game look complete.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997777164,6-Apr-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,I had hoped that after the last upgrade there'll be some improvement but how wrong I was! This one's even more annoying!! Why does gameplay control freeze all of a sudden when you're pressing attack or trying to defend? Only for AI to quickly disposess you of the ball and score or begin a counter! Very silly annoying game! Y'all should better do well!!!ð¡ð¡ð¡ Wish I can rate below 1-star!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999733865,1-Apr-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,This game is very nice but the that make me rate this game four is because there is no champions league masters league europa league and etc.....Even you can't play an international cup...If when playing with an opponent and u pass the it take too long for player to pass the ball and there is too much pause when playing with an opponent so do something about it and make different park or pitch in the game like fc mobile....,POSITIVE,0,0.90370369,18-Apr-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,Totally rubbish! When you play against Al you're rigged to loose! Press is as good as not working. Through passes are intercepted including clear ones. Direction key just passes to the wrong player Only Al does it better. Passes are intercepted as long as it's inside Al's penalty box! And what's with players suddenly stopping and not moving unless l tap them again even when they had the cursor on them??? FIFA will always better than this silly game anyday!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999056518,17-Mar-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,You do not fix bad connection to servers in last update. I can not creat room in friend match and play with friends. I can not find player during searching for an opponent to play online Event-Pvp to get rewards. I have to stop and restart app many many times to avoid bad connections to servers. I hope to fix these problems as quickly as you can.,NEGATIVE,1,0.627254128,18-Apr-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,It has become virtually impossible for me to win online matches. I concede (scripted??) goals at 44:45+(1st half)  first attack of 2nd half and 89:30+. Players run over the ball  deliberately mispass  while my attacks invariably result in stalling for seconds so that the move is broken up. Over the last 3-4 updates  all my online matches seem doomed and totally scripted. I can easily guess which opponent attacks will result in goals  and matches I simply won't be allowed to win. Script level WOW,NEGATIVE,1,0.999344051,18-Mar-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,The game is overall good  but there should be a lot of adjustments  I love the game so much but the problems are way to much  the AI chooses times you win a match and the fact my defenders with above 95 jump cannot clear a cross is very annoying. Konami you guys are doing well but please adjust match scripting it's very frustrating. And also the AI always makes it out of any tight situation no matter how many players are on them  I start to wonder whether the tight possession rating is above 100,NEGATIVE,1,0.667471051,9-Apr-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,No doubt this is the best soccer game on mobile  thanks to EA. Cool graphics  game play and it's quite realistic. Not anyone is perfect thus few modifications needed i.e  we need a sort of career staff like that of the play station where we can compete in a local league of whatever country then advance to the UCL  Europa and more others even south American top championship. If EA does this  this game will not only be great but only ultimate choice...... Thanks,POSITIVE,0,0.999568164,18-Apr-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,It is a good game  the graphics are excellent  I have some observations about poor control  and some players  despite improving their level  remain normal  like an undeveloped player. This is a big problem  and unfair  and also the gameâs algorithms are biased towards the competitor who has weaker players  this is not fair. The nice thing is the new addition  related to moving players to get any formation I want. This is good progress. As for some players  their nationality must be changed.,POSITIVE,0,0.947349668,21-Mar-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,Nice game. Gives very realistic experience. Though it doesn't work that well on 3g ram androids. Edit: ok after the 2.7 update  it started to lag alot.

eFootballâ¢ 2024,You guys are doing great in terms of graphics and and commentary  but I have a list of things you need to work on. Firstly  we need to be able to see players stats for every tournament. We should be able to see goals Goals  assists  etc of each player. Secondly  there should be training for direct freekick. That's really needed too. Thirdly  we should be able to choose stadium or time. Every match is played at the same time. Add real time refree  not just pop him up when ever there is foul.,NEGATIVE,1,0.861892641,19-Apr-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,Terrible update!!! New v3.4.0 version felt like a good update  till I played it for like 5 hours. I appreciate that the animations are now improved  but it is even more harder to play  not because of gameplay improvements  but because some buttons  especially switch buttons are not working properly sometimes  making me concede more goals than often. I will update my feedback if I see changes  till you will get only 1 star from me!Edit: Not going to change my mind after playing more! Just TERRIBL,NEGATIVE,1,0.990214467,23-Mar-24
eFootballâ¢ 2024,A very interesting game with very nice graphics but I just hate all these fixed matches. You find that there are matches where your players can't do anything meaningful and when you're about to score you just find yourself hitting the post or the game just hangs and you loose the ball. Then you need to add a list of Top scorers and then show how the players get on and off the pitch before and after every match,NEGATIVE,1,0.997293055,21-Mar-24
Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,It's continuously entertaining whether you're upgrading  training your troops or attacking enemy players and monsters. It helps if you can afford to spend a few dollars to increase your resources. Anywhere from building materials  speed up tags gems and of course magical items. You could play without purchasing some help along items. But I love to move things along to keep the action going. Regardless I have really not often enjoyed playing games with this type of game engine. But here I am.,POSITIVE,0,0.998797536,3-Mar-24
Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,It plays by itself... You don't need to do anything thing just keep pressing a button. It is not the way shown in the picture. It is extremely bad. They show random things and you have to press the button they show only you cannot do anything on your wish. You can't keep any character you like there is a fixed character.. For the wars at the start simply they will make you win later they will make you loose.

Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,I love this game I spent a lot of time and effort and I love it my all time favorite mobile game it's super fun lots of things to do the only complaints I can say are you have to be shielded all the time if your not shielded everyone will just destroy your kingdom and it gets extremely frustrating and another thing is that you have to spend money on the game just so you don't have to wait it will take forever just to harvest create and build if you don't spend money other than that great game,POSITIVE,0,0.985292852,28-Apr-24
Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,I thoroughly enjoyed playing Lords Mobile! It provided me with an immersive and challenging gaming experience that kept me engaged from start to finish. The game's complexity and strategic depth made it a fascinating journey as I delved into the mechanics and analyzed different approaches to achieve victory. One aspect that truly stood out to me was the supportive community. Whenever I needed assistance or had questions  fellow players were quick to offer their help and share their insights.,POSITIVE,0,0.999813259,19-Apr-24
Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,Absolutely love Lords Mobile! This game has it all â engaging strategy  stunning graphics  and endless opportunities for epic battles and alliances. The kingdom-building aspect is addictive  and the PvP battles keep me on my toes. I appreciate the regular updates and events that keep the gameplay fresh. Sure  there are in-app purchases  but they're optional and don't detract from the overall experience. If you're a fan of strategy games  this is a must-play. Easily a 5-star game in my book! ,POSITIVE,0,0.999759495,19-Apr-24
Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,Game videos are awesome but actual game play does not look like videos shown. Battles are not that dramatic as shown in videos. Such videos motivates to play but it does not actually   because everything is slow. Technolab mine if available  than game research may move fast. King or leader is idiot and cannot be hidden  further you have to use sheild to keep leader safe and there is no option add que to shield  if you have more than 100 shields.This game about money invested for digital Kingdom.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997177839,25-Apr-24
Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,Fun to play and spend ur time. It has a good build up and fascinating background (I especially love the history of the heroes). Guild mates r like family.

Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,All pay to play. And there is literally nothing to actually play just upgrades. There is almost nothing you can do after day 3 without paying. You continue to need to pay because paying members will be able to raid and destroy your area  everything takes hours to upgrade and/ or cost money. I wondered why earning units are so high for this game on Mistplay.. now I know. You can't earn if you just sit idle. Waste of time and life,NEGATIVE,1,0.999745309,25-Apr-24
Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,I have been playing this game since 2020. Throughout the years  the game's experience has been worsening. The game is fixated on pay to play  with players spending hundreds and thousands to overpower the free to play players in the game. There are players that use illegal bots  and IGG is failing to resolve this issue. The moment your shield drops  you're instantly being scouted and you lose months of army building just for it to be destroyed in a matter of minutes.EDIT: Diplo board spammers too,NEGATIVE,1,0.999752939,27-Apr-24
Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,You guys show something else in ads and when I played the game it doesn't even marched a single thing that is shown in ads.

Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,Hey lords mobile team. I wish if you give some time to a problem that I face usually.. I have two accounts that I'm using. Sometimes when I want to switch to the other account  the login options become white and stop functioning. The solution is usually deleting the game and reinstall it. This is becoming annoying to be honest. I wish you can solve this problem as soon as possible. I'll give 2 stars  but I can give 5stars later if the problem is fixed and my request is answered. Thank you,NEGATIVE,1,0.99958533,24-Feb-24
Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,I switched to one star. I've been unable to play. Game won't load up after IGG symbol it just stays on a black screen. Tried uninstalling  restarting phone. And nothing. Reach out to support. Didn't see any response. Been several weeks. Very disappointed. Pretty far in the game just to be inconvenienced like this. And having castle completely zeroed. I would love to get my money back if it were possible.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999653339,4-Mar-24
Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,The ads were completely misleading  there was to strategy of any kind. Formulaic and boring. The screen is constantly clutered  the gameplay is boring and the ads are misleading. The HUD is confusing and clunky  it's impossible to tell what's going on outside of the individual 'challenges'. Would not recommend under any circumstances.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999762356,8-Feb-24
Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,I started playing because of the Godzilla aspect. I like the game but the 1 star review is due to the insane cost of getting the Godzilla hero skin. I had to open over 500 boxes to get the castle skin. To get the leader skin your looking at spending thousands of dollars! You'd need 7k crystals along with getting the portrait picture completed. I wasn't able to even complete that one. No more spending for me. If I was able to get both skins I'd been spending way more on this game in the future.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998461485,1-Apr-24
Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,Good game but it is a sit-and-wait game unless you are willing to pay for everything. I like playing but my play time is stuck in repeats. Nothing explains what is needed to fuse or fabricate. The game shows what you need to fuse or fabricate but not where or how to get it. This is frustrating. Most prompts are great but there are a lot that want you to spend money to further yourself in the game. It takes forever to upgrade and train.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997276723,10-Mar-24
Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,I've loved playing this game for many years. Now  bots have destroyed it for me. Large guilds have bots that notify them when your shield drops  that automatically go to resource tiles so it makes it hard for me to gather. It's no longer fun when you're going against people that have the computer run everything for them. Also  massively a pay to play kind of game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999421239,4-Mar-24
Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,Been playing for several months now. It's fun most of the time. Events are engaging and rewarding.

This game takes a lot of time or a lot of money to progress.,POSITIVE,0,0.99957639,28-Apr-24
Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,To avoid. Very slow and expensive game. They will do anything for marketing and to make you pay or to get a share for a very little in return.

To add  the adds has nothing to do with the game  that's pathetic.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998099387,31-Mar-24
Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,I'm a limited-pay player and to be consistently directed to these items to buy with the  !  is really makes me want to stop playing. The  !

Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,Played for 5 years  game is 100% pay to win. 80% of which is gambling. Most are too financially invested to quit. The developers are always adding increasingly expensive updates  items and gatcha systems. There's huge bot and cheating problem that gives any legitimate players a massive disadvantage.

Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,Pros: plays quickly at first. Lots of stuff to do. Auto translates foreign language. Cons: I played for months  and saw a single character of color that I could drop large amounts of cash on to be able to play and bring up to competitive levels. Women are present but either in pink armor or backline. Heavily rewards destroying new players  big drawbacks for not logging in constantly. Pay to win.

Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,Great game and awesome displays. It's interactive display makes it one of the best games around and you'll enjoy every bit of it..

Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,Toxic community and slack rules about how mant times the same person can attack you. I really wanted to like it but this one thing makes it impossible. Support wants too much info just to delete account. Uninstalled  i will never return. Clash of clans is at least playable without the gigantic setbacks.

Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,Fake advert and pictures used. Game is NOTHING like it is shown in the pictures. Heavy Pay to Play. Some characters cost $11 000 to max out their levels (there are 3 of them). Castle skins cost $30-$100 for EACH one which you need to level up which can cost $$$.

That being said  thereâs a lot to be careful about. Having played for 1 year and i have to say that this game is very good the graphic not so bad and very suitable for MMORPG.

Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,Don't bother. After your shield goes down you will get attacked relentlessly by high-level neighbors. They will steal all your goods and burn your city down while thousands of your troops cower in the infirmary  content to watch their city burn around them. Using another shield just delays the inevitable since there appears to be no limit on ppl attacking cities - I was attacked 12 times in 15 minutes by the same person! Anyone starting now will be lucky to survive a couple days without shield.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998446167,16-Apr-24
Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,the game was so good and smooth to play even if I don't have knowledge and experience about this before it has guide that's why I love to play . and one that I like the most is there's a pay out for PayPal and it's real I already get it even it is small it can help by playing longer to earn more on Paypal.,POSITIVE,0,0.999597013,22-Apr-24

Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,DONT PLAY THIS GAME. It's a terrible money pit and now it's plagued with 3rd party programs. Once upon a time ago it was fun. Human vs Human. Now most castles are bot controlled and many use warbot   that gives the user all information about everything. It is so dumb  the hype of growing your castle and searching for targets died years ago. Now its just assembly line for warbot users to find the last remaining Human players the second their shield drops. Game is utter garbage now  don't play.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999560893,17-Apr-24

Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,A TON of really fun game stuffed into one. The Godzilla v. Kong Collaboration has restored some of my faith in the game. Get into a good guild it makes a HUGE difference. Be prepared to spend A LOT of money in order to have a truly enjoyable experience. The game is biased towards those that like to spend $. I've learned a few tricks that help me with free gems and free $ for packs. Despite having a free version it offers 100x's more goodies to those who aren't afraid to spend that $$.,POSITIVE,0,0.9935776,18-Apr-24
Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,Typical build/base and upgrade game with lotta  things to do  to make you busy (at least in the beginning). Good graphic & design. Obviously all these games are designed for ppl to spend money BUT if it's fair and something you enjoy...why not. You join a clan and become part of a community  together helping each other to survive in a wild competitive digital world.

Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,On 6/20 I rated Lords Mobile as:  Ok . So now the ***** thing has gotten hold of me. It's a better time waster than the cloned bubble pop stuff. I'll re-rate from a two to a four. Maybe more as I get more hooked  eh? Continued after playing some time. 1) Make it possible to change refresh time. 2) If you folks actually want to make this game more pleasant  try setting up a  shield option . Kind of like the auto-fill for rallies. That's my further $0.02.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994382083,5-Mar-24

Lords Mobile Godzilla Kong War,One of the worst help centers ever. Alot of purchase problems they don't address it and never resolve it .

Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,You can absolutely tell the games are pre-fixed. If you are trying to complete a challenge  you will find yourself in match after match against only the highest boosters and watch their pieces  randomly fall  into extra move patterns.

Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,The game is wonderful and interesting. The more you play the more interesting it gets. Although after every match you need to see an AD as well for the special powers. I am having no problems in staring at the ADS as some of them are even playable. I wish I had more stars to rate this game.

Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Been playing for about a year and few months now. Game is absolutely predatory. I played a solo with purple booster and got halfway to the goal. Then when I use the special cat booster that can only be purchased with MONEY I lose FIVE times. Either I'm 4 points away from completing the solo or I can barely make it past the checkpoint. That was planned and executed. No way  a higher booster can be that unlucky. Uninstall.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997902036,22-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I came here to see if others were having the same experience as me and it looks like it. This game is fun but once you start actually winning then all of a sudden your opponent is either way more advanced than you or they give them unfair advantages. It'd be way more fun if both players had the same advantages and it was truly about skill. Sometimes I literally don't have anything on the board but my opponent will have endless opportunities for extra moves.,NEGATIVE,1,0.985953093,21-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I like it. It seems the winner is pre-chosen bc ALL the good matches fall into place for opponent - & I get 0- & it cuts time off my turn sometimes. It's VERY infuriating  but if you can take it & enjoy a challenging  fast-paced  STIMULATING game  it's a good one. They give fair rewards for free; it's indeed edgier if u spend $  unless u lose every round afterwards & lose all u just paid for; great customer service!!,POSITIVE,0,0.999607503,23-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I really did enjoy this game when I first started. Now  it's so blatantly geared only to get players to spend more real money. The game is very clearly pre-determined the winner each round  and if it's tracks that you will spend  it allows you to win about 30%. Just enough to keep is interested. Total bull anymore. The new booster they adv. So much for  real money they charge $5 per booster. What the hell is that about?!?,POSITIVE,0,0.927968204,26-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,If you like throwing money away and getting vague responses from a bot then this is the game for you. It's a great game but this is getting ridiculous. Constant glitches and disconnects  players somehow getting ALOT more time during their turns  only to hear some people may have a bad connection? Really? So that constitutes them getting more moves well after their clock has ran out? Because I can assure you I've never gotten that  unfortunate  in the game,NEGATIVE,1,0.999003112,21-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,It's not that. I understand skills  but when the game doesn't give u enough colors to make matches  then it's a problem with the game. And when u have boosters that don't work for  then it's in the game. U can use the booster that flies and blows up certain areas of the board  but doesn't benefit the players  it's the game. U can use the slime booster and it slimes everywhere but where the players want it to go.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999361217,5-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,The game is really annoying due to the lack of balance.

Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,This game is fun  but I'm beginning to see the same issues that others are discussing in the review section. My opponents are getting free turns without actually meeting the specific requirements to be awarded that combo booster  unusually fast timer  near infinite falling combos only on the opposing side  etc. I literally had a 160 point lead in a tournament and lost to the falling combos before they used a turn point. If you get this game  be aware the odds are stacked against you. Uninstall.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99764508,6-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,This game is garbage. It used to be a fun game way back when it first started but now I can tell if I'm going to win or lose before the match even starts. The program will drop the opponent extra move after extra move while you struggle to just get the 2 or 3 moves per round that are alloted to you. And good luck winning games when you're < 100 trophies from advancing your level! I still play the game but I wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to download it. There are much better games to play!!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.943519056,23-Mar-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,It was fun at first  but it seems like the more you play the less chances you get to win. The game boards that your opponent gets ALWAYS have several options for extra moves and bonuses and the game boards I get rarely have any bonus opportunities at all. And my opponents all seem to have better and more advanced boosters than I will be able to obtain for a while. It's not much fun to play anymore  it's more frustrating.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999220371,4-Feb-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,ð¥³ After SEVEN years  one would think you would have the ability  algorithm  programming  etc. to MATCH opponents fairly? ð§ The other match 3 games I play do not have this issue  thus making the game fair  rewarding  and enjoyable. Maybe you'll figure it out over the next 7 years? Do better. The marketing and graphics are phenomenal! I challenge the programming to step it up.,POSITIVE,0,0.999552906,24-Mar-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,This is the 2nd time I've downloaded this game to give it another try after disliking it greatly the first time. It is very fun on the 1st day. There is something wrong with the algorithm or something though. As soon as you win like 3 games you begin to be matched with people WAY above your skill level and that have bonus items that you won't have yet making it essentially impossible to ever win. Edit: changed from 2 stars to 1. It is very unfair. Technical issues that make it impossible to win,NEGATIVE,1,0.981409788,6-Feb-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I don't want to rate this game because I don't enjoy it anymore. It's super expensive  losing boosters right after you purchase it and making the level difficult for when it's your turn. The time for me runs down much faster than my opponent's time. Constantly stucking and always getting to a specific score  then losing the games the whole time. I'm rather deleting this game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999717295,21-Feb-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,After spending money on boosters  I lose more often than when I used free boosters. The last game I played  the opponent had x18 mushrooms  while NONE fell after making multiple 4-color matches  leaving the opponent with a 7k point lead in the first round out of 2 rounds with 2 moves each. 1 booster in particular is extremely powerful. When I play it  it's almost impossible to win  but when I play against that booster it's a guaranteed automatic loss. Fun & Spontaneous? Yes. FAIR? Nope.,POSITIVE,0,0.979218662,25-Feb-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Was fun in the beginning but after a month  I can see how my opponents get extra moves after moves just by existing  while I'm struggling to have at least one extra. Also had experience when the opponent time is over but he/ she is still able to make moves   not for few seconds  I'm talking about 10 - 15 sec after the time ends ! For this game it's a lot of time.,POSITIVE,0,0.989717007,4-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Probably one of the least rewarding games. More than half of the game is luck. There is a pay to win feature that gives you power-ups that you will rarely see if you don't spend money. Numerous times I've been ahead of my opponent by over 100 points near the final round and they will get a crazy combo. Also numerous times I won't have more than three pieces to match and my opponent will get extra turns back to back. If this game had more puzzles and solo play it would be worthwhile.,NEGATIVE,1,0.888500333,25-Feb-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I used to really love this game  I still kind of do. Unfortunately the app crashes all the time...during almost every game! I spend a lot of time collecting boosters and I have lost every last one of them and don't have any really anymore because of the crash issue. And when I write support  although they are nice and can be helpful a little  they only replaced one booster and refuse to replace anymore. I want my legendary boosters back! I will update this if support can make this right for me!,NEGATIVE,1,0.998794556,16-Mar-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I really enjoy this game. However  it is a HUGE money grab. There is no way to get coins (the boosters and power-ups cost at least 150  but in normal matches  you only win 20 coins at the most). The game will match you with players that have 3 star boosters meanwhile I may be playing with a low level item. Also the ridiculousness of freezing the timer for extra moves is excessive. So people can easily rack up a 100 point lead and use a powerup I'm not even high enough in level to get.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998233438,4-Mar-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I gave this game one star  not because I don't like it  but because I think it's rigged against the blue player. Your odds are poor  unless you purchase the best boosters and can manipulate the board quickly. I believe AI may be used for opponents to play against blue players. It's very frustrating because you can easily become addicted to the game  and then want to purchase expensive boosters in order to win. Then it becomes a vicious cycle in which you will keep buying more boosters.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999346197,17-Feb-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I liked the game when I first started playing. Now  I'm not so sure. The other opponent for some reason goes first all the time and has endless moves. I think this game is rigged. When it is my turn  there's barely any moves. The boosters barely help unless you spend money and I have. I would have more points and then at the last second  my opponent wins every time. The new update sucks  it force closes most of the time causing me to lose. When this happens  my booster is also lost. Why?,NEGATIVE,1,0.999611914,12-Mar-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,This game turned into a BIG MONEY GRAB. The recent changes added Mixy Meow  which is almost impossible to beat. I say almost because on the rare occasion you get someone who doesnt use it well you could possibly win. They added a super OP booster to target the big spenders. To top it all off they cut down on the amount of free coins you get. I used to love this game and wouldn't mind spending some money for some neat pack. However  Im to the point I would much rather delete the greedy game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.991976082,25-Feb-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Like many others have already pointed out  the algorithms and  cheating  in this game really zaps any enjoyment that used to come with playing. When an opponent recieves 10+ extra moves every turn while you only recieve 1 or 2  there is absolutely no way to win. It gets far worse if you're about to level up or if you've achieved  On Fire  status-- you can GUARANTEE the next round will be a loss. It's predictable and discouraging to the point I have quit spending on it and play far less.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999773324,2-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,It was a great game. But  from recently it has increased the prices. I have to pay 9X amount to get the similar items I bought for X amount. Very bad. Only play one or two games per day now. If the things continue this way  obviously you guys will lose a lot. Sad to see this behaviour. ---------- The game is not equal at all. When it needs to make you lose  it is unplayable irrespective to the booster. Very dissatisfied of that.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999705374,22-Feb-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Horrible matching  you could of just started playing and your matched with individuals that have all the upgraded items. This app lacks a common sense design. Visually it's great  but I'm actually about the game  and these designers didn't think that getting mopped by 200+ points on my first game wouldn't get me to uninstall it. Great idea  great UI  incompetent match making.,POSITIVE,0,0.981089115,28-Feb-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,The algorithm is terrible  crazy how my opponent gets 4 or 5 random extra moves while the pieces are falling and not because of their strategy smh also heard some opponents are bots and not actually other ppl  easy to believe when the  extra move tornadoes happen!  Too much $ to compete and not worth it  it's an endless money grab and not many rewards for spending. Dumping this soon and going back to the PS5 where you buy a game at a set price and can enjoy it without spending loads.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999601543,26-Mar-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Its a fun game  but... I feel that the game is incredibly unfair. When selecting competitors  the selection process should not allow a player with a higher level card play against a player with a lower level card. It's impossible to beat. Making the playing experience short. Then  you have to wait too long before your cards generate. I've considered uninstalling the game for this reason.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999125302,6-Feb-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Way to expensive. Not fun anymore especially when you use real money to purchase them you lose your booster straight away 1st 2nd and 3rd should get to keep boosters coz this is getting ridiculous. Opponents has more time got screen record to prove it they. Game keeps freezing I've lost 4 SE boosters in 4 days. Only to be told they checked and can't help even though I have screen shots! Nice job mate......,NEGATIVE,1,0.998465061,23-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Great game Concept fun to play when you're matched up properly. But when you're matched up against someone. That has a diamond booster  and you just have a regular booster. You can't just use your luck because seems like they get drops of extra moves. Extra moves extra moves and I'm not sure. If the person you're playing is actually a person or if it's a computer on the other side. I have found that the time on My game goes really fast. The opponents drags on and they can go forever,NEGATIVE,1,0.982381761,7-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Updated review: I've been playing this game for about 1 1/2 yrs. While I do definitely still find it fun and engaging  like other reviews have said I also have noticed the games seem more rigged now. You'll be doing well and then nothing will drop to match at all so you'll lose. While I haven't minded paying for good boosters  after a while the more you get  the higher the cost! From $5-15 to $30-40 minimum  $20 if you're lucky! It's getting ridiculous and making it no fun to play.... ð¿,NEGATIVE,1,0.997470975,27-Apr-24

Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,It's a very fun game at times it could be the best game on the planet if they would fix the butt glitches and stop making them be able to win no matter what boosters I have. I've spent a lot of money on this game the more I pay the more I lose. It's a highly unfair game if you're playing a real person it's pretty fun it's even but when you play the box the box always win there's a glitch in The matrix,NEGATIVE,1,0.866178215,14-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,The game will glitch and boots me out of a match  which causes loss of boosters. This always happens when I'm ahead in a match. I stopped making in app purchases because of this reason and now since the update  in app purchases are required to unlock all features  which is a bummer! Also the game unfairly pairs you with people using better boosters or advanced skill so the more you play  the less you win. And good luck getting diamond stickers from the game as a gift! Never happens!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999183357,24-Feb-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Love the game but feels rigged when every round I play  the other player has a good board that I could win if I had. Always good pieces on the other person's go. There is no point at playing after a couple hours unless I keep playing until I get a one off good board. Seems like a tac tic to keep people playing for longer,NEGATIVE,1,0.986339927,28-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Great game  have been playing it for years but they have brought in new super cards which are a complete let down  has ruined the game completely  you get matched up with someone with this card you might as well give up straight away. Not fair at all!! My advice...get rid of them... your going to loose more players than make money on them as there just isn't any point in playing anymore. I do spend money on in app purchases & still can't win against them.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999667883,26-Feb-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,This game is designed to keep you spending money once you start. Also their algorithm keeps you in a certain position until they deem you have met spending quota. Lastly  I don't believe some people you play against are real. I think they randomly deploy profiles or take over profiles to entice purchases and spending. I've noticed if I have a lot of super boosters  I will lose them on unbelievably unfair drops during play. Best choice is to stop playing. Games shouldn't cause frustration vs fun.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998318434,9-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,the game is fun but the balancing in a pvp platform needs to allow players to still make some sort of comeback. Usually when me or an opponent takes all the  extra move  turn 1 or 2 in combination of the perks and power ups racking 80+ points just makes it into pointless uphill battle for the next 4 rounds of trying to catch up to a ridiculous lead.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999223709,9-Feb-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,This game is adventurous  challenging  fun and helps with quick thinking and planing skills along with reaction skills. I would like to see win streak bonus. The longer the win streak the more trophies won for that game. For example: three in a row games won the third game gives you three times the amount of trophies received. A normal win gives you 25 trophies so the win streak would be a total of 75 trophies.,POSITIVE,0,0.999342024,23-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I hate the fact that the game can actually be fun  but that gets taken away on EVERY competition when the  so called  opponent gets set up for a landslide win EVERY time. I definitely am not going to waste my money anymore. Who wants to play a game where you are depressed before it's over. UPDATE: Just deleted  worst game ever!

Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I've changed my review due to the fact that there is a lot of lag in the game or the game freezes and crashes and I end up losing good boosters and perks. Often the images in the game are doubled or combined somehow. It is not my phone because I have other games on my phone they do not do this. I used to love playing this game so much but it's frustrating now. I was just in the middle of the game and it just suddenly shut off. So I lost one of my higher boosters and my perks.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999737442,28-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,This game used to be fun  but now it seems like it's rigged to make you lose intentionally. It allows your opponent to continue to make moves after the timer timed out  and then when you reach out to support  they say you lostðð well  yeah when you have the system set up to allow the opponent to keep making moves after the timer has timed out. They cheat and do nothing about it. It's only when you have bigger boosters though,NEGATIVE,1,0.997954726,26-Feb-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I've tried to give this game a chance but it's too frustrating  I have been very close to tossing my phone. Have been trying for 30 minutes and disconnected 6x and lost 2 boosters. Tried to contact help but unable to get a keyboard to type a message. I'd give 0 star  but that's not an option. I'm done! Not worth the aggravation and risk to my phone.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999734581,8-Mar-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Absolute con of a game. You now can't buy anything for less than 23 pound a pop.. if a game freezes you lose all your boosters and they if anytime inky . And the seasonal albums are a joke  I've had 4 left to get for ages and in the mean time had about 20 or more duplicates on the bounce. They say its random but if you unlock a new album you get stickers everytime until you get close to winning and then you get nothing.

Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,This game is actually my favorite game! I absolutely love playing it. Recently I had to get a replacement phone  which is a Nokia G100 and since I've had this phone Match Masters just closes after maybe 30 seconds of opening the app. I've tried numerous things to fix it with no luck. It's pretty disappointing actually.. That's my only reason for giving a 2 star rating. It would've been a 4 or 5 star rating otherwise.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999349177,25-Mar-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Not much difference from my last review. Used to come home at the end of the day to relax and play few games for fun. But seems like the game has lost its touch. If your having a bad day  this games doubles up the tension as the opponents have longer time to play and as soon as it is our turn the time just runs out immediately. Was a good game when it all started. Used to tell friends to join  but even they have un-installed this game. I just hope that the game improves.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996605396,12-Mar-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Super frustrating game! Opponent almost always goes first  gets the best boosters and plays  and it doesn't even count your extra moves correctly! Seems your opponent gets extra moves and a slower timer  they can go on forever! And  it goes through the entire last round when it's obvious there is a winner already. Stupid!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999651432,15-Mar-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Technical issues all the time. I had about 6 technical issues in two week and support always gave me back my booster. Got in contact with support today as I had two technical issues first time returned my booster second time the refused asked me to check my device and run a few tests. Removing a game I enjoyed because issues cannot be fixed. Terrible support that closes off a conversation without listening to a reply. Unhelpful  even when you spend money on their game. Keep away from it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.980499983,18-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Great game overall. Runs smoothly  no glitches for me  but expensive. Daily freebees are nice  but the purchase are too much. A super level booster purchase  with coins  equates to about $5 US bucks a pop  which you might lose in 2 min. Leveling up should be fun  but I wish I could roll back. It seems like more of a punishment  as to play with multi player games  you need to purchase mega-boosters. Getting too expensive to play  so im unfortunately going to have to say goodbye to this one.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995292425,17-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,seems like fun but everytime right before you are out of coins then your opponent would able to get 50+ points in just one round and endless booster to use.. just trying to make you to purchase coins to continue ... ðð cant disagree with most reviews  its lot more fun when you are at the lower level  once you reached certain level then basically who has the better  more powerful booster will win.

Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,This game is highly rigged and Zi have screen recordings of proving it. If you soend money you can make some advancement but its only temporary. The opponent always gets all the extra moves   their timer is slower and stops for every play when the player makes a move using a booster  their timer actually speeds up The opponent gets 1:50 minutes and the player gets 20 seconds. The pairing of players is highly unfair because the opponent has very powerful boosters and the player has weak ones.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999485612,21-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Absolutely love playing the game however hate that I am randomly disconnected from the game while playing multiple times per day. I have lost many powerful boosters and trophies due to this occurrence. When you contact customer support most times they will not return your boosters and trophies are never returned. The same response from customer service is stated every time with no improvement.

Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I love this game  however the constant lagging (despite good phone signal  internet connection & being up to date within the app & Googleplay ð±) causing me to lose games - which means I'm losing out on money spent as I lose my decent cards! I've had several experiences of starting my go then being told my time has run out  despite the timer showing my turn has just started!! ð¤¯ If this didn't keep happening then I'd happily give the game 4/5* This has nothing whatsoever to do with skill or luck,NEGATIVE,1,0.999623299,5-Apr-24

This happens constantly. Every single time I've tried to play recently. It's become very aggravating and it's made me not want to even  try  to play anymore because I know it's just going to close every time I'm playing & force me to lose the game.

Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,In your face  without a shame unfair. Sometimes it feels like the opponent is the bot who mindlessly without any hesitation makes the best matches right away when it's turn comes. Its hilariously obvious how pay to win oriented this game is. Not only that  the ads is this game are obnoxious as hell  you watch 30-40 sec of an ad  than another 10 sec of the still screen  and another 10 of the logo for a minimum reward to get yourself the most basic booster and then loose in the worst way possible.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997427762,20-Feb-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,So they take away the Masters Club. You have to watch stupid advertisements just to get a better booster or stickers  and even then  it's useless. The spins value isn't fair  and it takes entirely too long to earn stars. 9 times out of 10  I'm always paired up with the 3 star boosters to my silver and gold.

Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Great concept!!!! Game is crazy good until you play more & more. It really is not a fair game. Why is it when it's the opponents turn it goes on & on. Explosion here  there & everywhere for multiple times. Then your turn comes up  you be lucky to get one explosion.

In the moments when I manage to win more matches  after 16 matches  I'm in match with a very good player  with a much better booster  and even if I have a legendary booster  I don't have on the board blue pieces and I can't activate my booster  and after the end of the time  the red player can still make 3-4 moves.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998818457,20-Feb-24

Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I think the the brains of the Candivore crew have left the building. This game  at one time  was the best match three game around  in my opinion. I can't say that anymore. Too much!! It's now cluttered with too many  extras . You pretty much have to spend money now if you want to do anything at all. Terrible rewards. Not worth playing anymore.

Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,It's good  but if definitely could be better. If they did things like giving out more new stickers than a bunch of duplicates especially for the seasonal albums. That would be great. Also  the booster the the person loses when they lose the winning person should get it. They should increase the wheel to a couple times a day  instead of 24 hours. And give out more diamond  legendary and SE boosters with the box you get every couple of hours. more coins  trophies and points to receive more stuff.,NEGATIVE,1,0.798480153,22-Feb-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Fantastic game. No ads really- nothing popping up mid game. Very addictive- could play for hours. Edit: While my above review still stands true  I've found that the matches for the games are unfair. I think they should put a filter in that makes it so you don't match with a higher level booster. At least make it so that you're playing at the same level booster. The perks have been a fun addition  but with certain boosters  it doesn't equal a very fun game. Hopefully changes they'll make. :),NEGATIVE,1,0.982062936,1-Mar-24

Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Great game overall  exciting gamellay with real opponents. Only drawback is that they scale purchases with past purchasing history. So the first time you buy 1 booster it's $0.99. But if you buy the same booster later its $1.99  buy the same booster again later and it's $4.99  and they'll essentially scale up the price until you're paying $25+ for any booster(s) which initally was $0.99.

Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I like the game. However it's very frustrating because it freezes up a lot. You may be in the middle of a move and it'll freeze right in the middle of it but your time is still running and you run out of time before the move ever completes. I thought maybe it had to do with my phone but this is the only app that it does that to. Reply to Candivore  please read your reply to my problem until it makes sense to you. I said that there is a problem with the game freezing up. Nothing to do w/skill,NEGATIVE,1,0.999528766,3-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I enjoyed the game when doing the learning rounds. I just lost 7 rounds ALL to SE cards. If this game isn't rigged  then those people could have played against each other. You should never have to play one boost above/below yours. When I see an SE boost  I just quit and let them win. I've never paid  I'd consider buying perks but because you lose them even if you win  they're not worth it. You lose your boost in a solo game unless you hit all tiers  which is absurd.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995387018,28-Mar-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Game frequently resets itself after the match begins. 1st i thought it was my phone so I installed it on a different phone and a tablet and despite all devices rocking 5g  full bars the issue persist. I've spent $ purchasing coins and then when. I open the game up later on it either doesn't show my coins or the items I used them to purchase! Then there's the game play itself  the timers aren't keeping time correctly for each players turn. I used a stopwatch to time each players turn to find it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998319924,5-Feb-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Every game is massively 1 sided in your opponents favor   lost 10 games in a row and uninstalled  your turn you get 2 basic moves then when its your opponents turn suddenly its  extra move  extra move   boost ready   extra move  boost ready  and you're 100 points behind   i lost a game 38â350  i guess its to trick you into buying better boosts.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998338461,29-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I absolutely LOVE this game! It's literally my favorite and I have tried out and have played many games. The graphics are amazing and super fun. The game play is challenging  but not to the point that you will never win a match. I am impressed that the game developer gives out free items daily on social media platforms. So many developers have become greedy after the game gets enough traction. I have a lot of respect for the fact that they are not doing that with this game. TRY IT ð,POSITIVE,0,0.999444783,26-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I finally have up and uninstalled. I wish there was skill involved  but this is 95% a game of luck. Can be fun  but it balances very poorly more often than not. It can suck pretty hard when the luck goes wrong and you go from playing better to being played by the game itself  because your opponent gets a bunch of freebies in a row...,NEGATIVE,1,0.997716308,20-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,When I first downloaded this game I loved it!! However after a week of game play I am now being matched with opponents whose cards are so much more advanced that there is no skill involved in the game play and it is a massacre. In addition  the cost to purchase any of the bonus cards with actual money is so ridiculously expensive. Developers please consider matching players with similar card levels and I would happily pay for this game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998359144,11-Feb-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Features in app have ceased to function  like the ability to watch ads for daily rewards and the ability to watch ads to conjure a different set of boosters  perks and stickers. It's not an issue with my phone because other members on my team are experiencing this issue as well. Dropped my rating from 4 to 1 star  I'll think about changing it back if the problem gets resolved. Sure glad I'm not spending money on items  it's not a very good incentive to.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998587251,15-Feb-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,It's a relatively fun game. However as of late I have begun noticing a few things that don't add up. Players using double of the same perk  players seem to have favourable matches. Matches are instantaneous where the player is from the other side of the world is more than likely a bot. A lot of the game is centred around paying real money for essentials  you don't have to of course but you need cards and perks  and if you don't have any coins you have no choice but to splash some cash.,POSITIVE,0,0.987465024,25-Feb-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Money grabbing and riggery. Super stingy with stickers  there are only four days and four slots to swap seasonal and they are only a preselected few. Very unfair pairings and USELESS customer service. I reported  with photo evidence  where opponent was granted extra moves where he did not have any and was told its just  lags . Surprisingly I never get those. Your matches are rigged so newly purchased boosters disappear in a first game and then they raise prices of them. I'm done.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999789417,29-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Deleted the game. After a few days of playing  I'd give this game a -5 rating if I could. This game is so unmatched with the tricks. Player 2 will get pieces perfectly aligned 8 times in one turn and then you get nonthing. I am only playing to get my Fetch pts. Its like Bamboozled  it makes no sense and reminds me of Friends with the totally made-up rules  heaven forbid they  explain how to play with real instructions. Don't waste your time on this one. I HATE this game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998318434,22-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I used to love this game more than anything! I spent so much money on it trying to get the good boosters just to lose them due to the technical glitches. They will make sure that you lose a certain amount of time to have to spend more money I've noticed that. When you tell them that you lost major boosters due to technical issues they'll tell you there's nothing they can do about it  and you're just out that money and those boosters.

Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Just learning this game  so it is hit n miss for now. Game is ok. What I want to know it why am I updating everything in my fone 2 to 4 times a week. 4-20-24 new review  well I have updated this game  9 times in7 days. Everytime after the update it installs. And with in 3 minutes after completing the install. I get a quick flash notification saying it was unable to complete. I can't do a screenshot of it cause it's so fast. When I got to pull my notifications up it's not there. What's up?,NEGATIVE,1,0.96958667,20-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,This game sucks  it's obviously rigged. Not even a pay to win game either because you'll lose quicker buying in app purchases than u would with their free stuff. Not recommended for anyone  I've wasted so much money and I'm deleting this awful game and never playing it Again! Also it lags a lot especially when it's just your turn and not your opponents.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999641657,20-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I enjoy playing the game but every time I start playing the game I'm in the middle of a match and the game glitches and cuts off and I tried to go back and I can't go back to my match. I purchased my boosters and it takes my boosters and I feel like I need a refund for that. this is one of my favorite is games and if you'd fix that glitch where it quits cutting off the game would be great.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997101247,19-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,It's horrible. When this game wants you to lose  you lose. You won't get matched with people around the same cards as you. No you'll have 2 and 3 level diamond cards and get matched with legendary and super edition cards so you'll lose. It's ridiculous I have diamond cards and they'll match with the super edition train  I left the game 3 times and each time matched me right back with the train. They'll respond to this and say it's fair but trust me it's not. Don't bother downloading this.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998667717,23-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Frustrating at best. You lose cards when you lose  but gain nothing when you win. There no way to pause  and lack of a single player option makes this way more frustrating than it's worth.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999246001,19-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,It is such an amazing app! I enjoy it a lot! The only thing I would change was that my opponents always get the extras and lightning bolts and best the higher booster which I find unfair. But I loved the tmnt collab it's one of my favorite shows! 5 stars! Keep up the great work! ð,POSITIVE,0,0.999515533,25-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I like this game very much  but the technical delay that causes the loss of Booster is very annoying and the opponent with SB Booster against weak Booster is also not okay  no new stickers  only double ones are also not OK  it seems to me that people who don't spend money have no chance for a fair game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998569727,23-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,This game literally just mismatches players who have more skill than others. Why do you think they sometimes offer a game mode limiting to certain boosters and you think it's a coincidence in those specific game modes they cut your trophies and event points in half? Its because they can't versus you unfairly meaning they cut the points in half because you win more games because there algorithm can't cheat you,NEGATIVE,1,0.999066651,22-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Very addicting! ð Man I just spent 5 bucks for the super wheel.. got 3 of the same booster!

Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I give the game a 5 Stars... The only complaint is that my account got mixed up somehow and it keep putting me back and forth between games for some reason. Update. They successfully regained my account. The only problem I have now is they said they cannot give lost boosters to a phone that is older like mine. How can they get u hooked on a game then tell u ur phone is outdated when u have been a loyal  paying customer.? Even after all this  still.one of my all.time favs,NEGATIVE,1,0.998788893,19-Apr-24

Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I'm really annoyed  collected 300 duplicate stickers for the super spin wheel and nothing it was just loading but I was unable to spin. Worse customer service have logged 4 tickets they just automatically closed. #7164161 once again lagging and the game just kicks you out no resolution from support team ticket #7264004 you respond on platforms but behind close doors you do absolutely nothing.

Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Heres exactly what I'm talking about. Get a free spin on the wheel and get legendary. I know they always get back what they give for free. Free legendary  use it and my color doesn't never shows together to make a match. And lose to lesser by 400 points. The other way around  lose by 4000 points. It's rigged.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997986794,24-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,Sometimes aggrivating I kinda like this game actually  But it can sometimes be rigged. You see  I'm in Plunder Pirates and It's rare to find diamond boosters there. But when I see a diamond booster  I already know I'll lose the match. And It's p2w. And I remember that one time on another account I got a doctor color and when I tried to use it  It told me to earn 12 000 trophies  When I get it  I get it. And I'm not asking for it back.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99687469,26-Apr-24
Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,It used to be a good game .But for now it's not anymore the more you play the more you lose your boosters It's too rare for me to get extra moves but the opponent gets a lot of them.

Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,This game is absolutely rigged. It's fun at first but when you get to the higher ranks you can barely win. For example I just had the robot card and they paired me with the new cat card. I got a score of 2700 and I quit the game  the opponent had a score of over 7000. I've played like 25 games tonight and won maybe 3. It's absolutely ridiculous and I won't be spending another dime on this game. Edit since they want to say they pair similar no they don't.

Match Masters â- PvP Match 3,I love playing this  but now all of a sudden it's telling me I have to update to continue playing. It's been  updating  for the past 4 days and it won't let me play now. Fix this. Now it's kicking me out in the middle of the game and I'm losing all my perks and boosters!

Evony: The King's Return,Just not a fun use of game time. With no real point  the  adventure  shoot em up part of it isn't challenging  the empire building is boring and the screen is filled with ways to spend real money on useless items. A few days of this was enough to have me moving on. Don't waste your time on it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999631763,29-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,Very fun game  good graphics  always something new to do. Been playing for a year and a half. It is absolutely pay to play. Minimum to be relevant is about 300$ a month... to be competitive you will have to spend significantly more. Can you play for free yes. However  Evony claims everyone has access  and there are many items and opportunities that require purchases to access. Because I have refused to spend money I have never had several powerful things that prevent me from achieving goals.,POSITIVE,0,0.992923498,23-Mar-24
Evony: The King's Return,I was deceived by this game ads for puzzle mini games. It is actually a castle build/war game against monsters and other castles. It's a very slow to upgrade enough to be able to fight monsters yourself and earn rewards. Best case  you join a powerful alliance and you level up sooner. This game is an addictive upkeep  but really a waste of time. I wish I never tried it. Many years later  I rarely play except for weekly event to add a protective bubble and feel guilty leaving my alliance.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998247862,19-Feb-24
Evony: The King's Return,Customer service is still laughable at best. The ads that are running now with puzzles are only available to newer servers  generals you get help in mini games that aren't available to older servers. They turn out new events weekly with more pay to win prizes. You don't need to spend but you'll never get top rewards and your growth won't be able to keep up with small coining players. Anything to make money instead of fixing issues in battles and taking care of customer complaints.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998858929,26-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,It's a pay to play game. Though it is still doable to progress when you go in without spending (you just gotta have wealthy allies). I always say this game is for those with money and time (its like having a second job). It's a fun game but can get absolutely addicting and worse when you start spending. $5 a week turns into 20-100$. I enjoyed playing it for a year til I just had to stop spending and the slow progress made me lose interest. There are always new events which keeps it fun.,NEGATIVE,1,0.771032155,7-Feb-24
Evony: The King's Return,Another fake ad showing a puzzle game.... Puzzles may be a small part of this game  but you are launched straight into building and upgrading a city and characters  showing paid options etc. Couldn't be bothered to play much longer  it may be OK but not what was advertised  not what I wanted. Uninstalled.,NEGATIVE,1,0.991631091,15-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,Been playing for just over a year  still not bored  only problem is when you update game  you can loose things you've earned from events  annoying  also features change that don't work well. New march notice on screen keeps popping up all the time  annoying when your searching the map  not a good change  if it's not broken  don't try to fix it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999434888,23-Mar-24
Evony: The King's Return,I've seen other pay to play games but this one could give lessons. Every part of the experience is monetized. The games are mindlessly repetitive and incredibly easy. And yet  this game requires a TON of processing time  freezing and draining my battery.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997243285,29-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,I love playing this game. However  i have a few major issues. 1. the game freezes or crashes alot. Mostly it happens while you're In the middle of fighting other players. #2 is that you have to spend thousands of dollars a week or you'll never be able to compete with top players. #3 I've spent thousands on this game and the customer service is horrendous. UPDATE: after over a month they finally reimbursed me so I changed review from 1 star to 3 stars,NEGATIVE,1,0.998513997,21-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,Customer service doesn't care to actually help. You buy packages and some things are not even awarded. You message CS and they refute it and say everything went through fine. Never actually try to help. Besides that the ads are indeed misleading. The game is kinda fun when you have a good alliance. But you still have to coin in order to progress at a decent rate. So you basically have to coin but half the packages don't give you all the rewards stated. ð¤ Replying to my review but not helping,NEGATIVE,1,0.974484503,7-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,Good game. Lots of stuff to do. Is primarily a pay to play game. To be powerful  you're looking at at least $2000 a month  to be average  it's $500  and f2p  you have to mooch off the paying players. Lots of bot use  which makes fair play challenging and if you get stuck in a server with tyrannical players  there's not much help and no way to move to a better server without starting from scratch. The chat feature is one of the best I've seen  so it's easy to be social and make friends.,POSITIVE,0,0.996399403,19-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,Academy science for me is malfunctioning. If I upgrade something in advancement and it has 7 hrs 15 mins and 30 secs on it. I speed up the 7 hrs and the 15 mins. It restarts and before I can use gems in the remaining seconds  it adds 15 minutes to time. So trying to upgrade quickly is a waste of speed ups if it just adds time on the backside. I have contacted support and nothing is being done. It's been a week and still nothing. Is this how it is  you spend money  you get robbed . 0 stars,NEGATIVE,1,0.999785602,28-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,The ads leave out the part where it's just another pay or wait boring city sim. Hi  please re red my review where I pint out that the other aspects of the game are an oyi g  boring  and generic. Your main selling point is why I wanted to play  the 'lot to discover' is what made me uninstall it. Further  your ads DO NOT show the city building aspects so now you are lying about your false advertising. I'll make sure to report the ad where we I see it now  thanks!,NEGATIVE,1,0.99895978,15-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,The game is fine  but for the amount you have to spend to be competitive  customer service and support completely sucks. I have spent tons on this game  and whenever I have issues  I get no resolution... only  We understand you are having problems... but we're just going to ignore them . I highly recommend that you spend zero dollars and just do free play  however free play will not make you competitive unless you do like some and bot 100 cities that just collect resources.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998639405,23-Mar-24
Evony: The King's Return,There are too many events going on at the same time. The game is geared towards money players. Old general's are made obsolete by constantly introducing new ones. Which are more difficult to ascend unless spending crazy amounts of money. It was fun when I started playing. The only reason I play now is the people and friendships that have developed. The game itself sucks now. You asked for a rating. I was more than happy to keep my opinion to myself. Now will you turn off that reminder in setting,NEGATIVE,1,0.998136997,23-Mar-24
Evony: The King's Return,Paid some package  didn't get some items in those. Asked for help to customer service. Awful customer support system. Only received messages for try to reboot or send screen shot. Never gets forward next conversation .after 24 hours   still the same.... Game is fun. Just a customer support system is very poor.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997588038,29-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,it's way complicated. no possible strategy  buildings are only built and upgraded in a certain order. can't be upgraded until another is a certain level. stuck from progressing because I need something that I can't even build. and upgrading takes progressively longer. to get you to spend money and no other reason. also the spend money stuff is literally everwhere.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99931848,10-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,The worst game to play if you pay . And if you expect replies from customer support  forget about it. It's just for show. They reply for you first message and never ever solve your problem or reply back after that. In game purchases are a hoax. Half the time what you purchase as never fully in your inventory. Try to tell that to customer support  they'll vanish faster than the flash. My tickets have never been solved. Worst customer service ever.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999804676,13-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,Every update makes the game laggy and glitches are very common. The game kicks you out of play whenever it feels like it! Like in the middle of battle  the game will shut off and no let you back in for like 5 minutes after multiple times trying to get back on. You must spend your life savings to advance in the game. Ridiculous amounts of RSS to build city up. They want you to spend tons of money for bad upgrades/updates. Too many glitches and lagging. Then randomly being kicked out of the game,NEGATIVE,1,0.99953258,19-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,I've been playing for a good few months  an this game is honestly just a shameless cash grab. The people that play it are a bit crazy  but that's probably because any significant player in any given server has dropped hundreds of dollars on the game. I can guarantee that it's almost nothing like the ads  this isn't even close to a puzzle game. Sure  the puzzles are a small section of the gameplay  but they're easy to forget about.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999346316,17-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,Misleading trailer  the game is nothing like the trailer. I have played this game for almost 2 years now. I do enjoy some parts. I am lucky bc the server I am in is reasonable and we help each other out. It does take dedication and patience. It is definitely pay to win but if you are patient enough you can get by without spending real world money. My issue is with the advertising. I do not see where any of this is in the game. Be true to your ad.,POSITIVE,0,0.929058313,29-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,After an year of playing  reducing the rating. Highly pay to win. You will progress really slow and they keep luring you to spend. There are far too many events and unlike other games  there is no way for F2P players to get ahead. Even spending is not worth as you will never do enough.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995918095,29-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,Love the interaction with players. The game is rigged for big spenders  so expect to pay a lot to even come close to being a medium player and a high amount to be a big player. It's not a friend to those who are poor. The strategies are not that great  and the bugs there are lots.. it has gone downhill. Use to be fun but now they are greedy. The changes are always things that use money and no way to get it without money. STINKS... your response vague you still do not make it easy for non-paying.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998198092,19-Feb-24
Evony: The King's Return,So far cool game. Still in the beginning stages but definitely entertaining. UPDATE: 4/8/24 Been playing over a year now. Game is ok the alliance members make it worth coming back to play. Everything in this game costs money  if you want to he competitive. There are more glitches then in anything I have ever been apart of. And when a glitch happened the game higher ups deny responsibility. I still play but if you don't already don't start you will be better off,POSITIVE,0,0.997699916,8-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,Just so everyone knows  don't trust the ads or the pix for the description of the game! There is no dodge and shoot or challenge to the end thing and the puzzles don't resemble anything like the one shown! It is a War game! It does have puzzles  but this is a PVP game!!! ðð¤£ð Edit: Upgrading your keep does NOT unlock the dodge and shoot or challenge to the end! Stop lying to people  devs!

Evony: The King's Return,False Advertising  the game is nothing like the ads and images shown on the play store page. Such a shame. My reply to the developer response: then make it clear in the ads specifically where players will encounter such gameplay  otherwise it might as well be false advertising. Since I never encountered it means that neither did other players i.e. if it isn't representative of the general player experience means its false advertising in my book.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999725282,24-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,This game  which advertises as being exactly like their ads  IS NOTHING LIKE THE ADS! Some ads show scenes that appear rarely  most not at all.

Evony: The King's Return,I want my money back Due to user error the link between the game and Facebook got severed and thus login was no longer possible. After initially providing a sensible recovery option their  support  (lol) are now telling me that the  lost  account has to contact them in-game to provide the details due to data privacy.

Evony: The King's Return,The game is good  but customer service was not  i had sent a ticket more than 2 months ago and every week i asked for follow up and no good response.

Evony: The King's Return,None of what they show in the videos has anything to do with this game!!!!!!!! There is no moving or shooting! They spend more time making videos that lie to people than making the game worth playing. Update 01/2022: Keys to success are joining an active alliance and putting in time and effort...the only way to get around that is $$$. Dropped a star because game lag and glitches are starting to get really bad...to the point that it interferes with your ability to fight effectively.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999796569,23-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,Latest update broke the game for Android users. Larger boss monsters are showing up as placeholder monsters and are unable to be attacked. Multiple tickets sent in with no solution. In game support can't help as it is a programming issue. Roll back the version or fix the current one! As of 4/9/2024,NEGATIVE,1,0.974902928,10-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,I have to reduce my 5star rating. It is fun game you actually play. But the customer support is definitely lacking. It has improved in the last few months but not enough. Most tickets are closed with a sorry for delay. Or they send a note asking for what you included in your request. Its weeks before a response. The notification ingame for customer support response to doesnt work. Except when they close the ticket. Which is what happens 97% of the time without resolution.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999114215,23-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,The pop ups. The forced pay to play if you want to have any chance at being among the top. The inability to participate in events if you don't pay... but seriously the pop ups... every time I log in and when I switch screens it's trying to make me buy something then invite friends then some other stupid pop up. JUST LET ME PLAY AND STOP HARASSING ME AND PUTTING POP UPS IN MY FACE! I just wanted to play a puzzle game >:(,NEGATIVE,1,0.998482049,8-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,It seemed fun  but for some reason i have issue with hit register. I could stand in front of a monster and my shots never hit. Big difference than the advertisements. i was looking forward to it but not after i tried the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.888043582,24-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,Just another clic and wait game  some gameplay is kinda like the ad  but the core game is just an idle builder. Click something  wait some time  clic another thing  wait again  clic on resourcea until you get enough for an updgrade  clic once more  and so on. Also 2gb for a game you will barely play is nuts.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997231781,26-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,i am on server 1426 buzztroop  spent over 40k in one year. my game is bugged so that all larger bosses suddenly disappear or turn into lower bosses when i scroll over them. i contacted customer service 6 times in one day to try to get someone to help me  that actually knows what is going on. nothing. please do not get involved in this pay to win game. no support and zero care even for someone who spent as much as i did.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999781907,9-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,Very addicting game. You come for the puzzles and stay for the comradery. It's a pay to play game for sure. Unfortunately there is rampant cheating which is overlooked by support if the party cheating pays enough money to play. This diminishes the experience for casual players and small spenders.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998087704,8-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,WASTE OF YOUR TIME AND MONEY!! The game constantly has problems and no one in CS cares to fix anything. Recently I noticed that I couldn't see any of the large bosses on the map that others can see. Reached out to CS 5 times and only 1 responses. Saw a lot of postes online with several people complaining of the same issue that CS responded to admitting they did it on purpose because they were suspected of cheating  without proof or notice to the player. Still waiting and it's been weeks.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999632955,14-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,1 year player's experience: Unplayable for free to play or low coiners. The amount of rng needed for even mid coiners to even be able to have a good build is ridiculous. This is a game for coiners who spend $2000+ every event. The rest of the playerbase is just wasting their time  no matter what the devs try to tell you. Grinding will get you nowhere or make such insignificant progress  It's a waste of time. CS is absolutely trash.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999816477,25-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,Yea  this game asks for a lot of money You can spend a lot of money to gamble whether you will get what the game package says you can get. The in-game gambling does occur. You will have to gamble other players that drop 100$  and if you were in 1st place for anything then that next person bumped you you will not get the items you just bought it will go to first place. It's like an online auction. And other players will get the satisfaction of taking away everything you buy. Yes they can steal,NEGATIVE,1,0.994355083,21-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,This game has always been a money grab  but it is getting worse and worse. Popups with  special offers  constantly get in the way when you are trying to do actions which are extremely time-sensitive. The advertisements for the game have never had any actual gameplay footage  and they are now further from the game reality than ever.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997375369,27-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,So I left a review Feb 2020. The game used to be almost even between free to play and pay to win. Now  because of evonys many rules and the near impossible level system  it's near impossible to progress past level 36 unless you either spend a lot of money or you make 5+ accounts to act as  farming accounts . People who literally can't afford to spend money on games resort to multiple accounts or bot system which both is against evony rules. Of course putting all favors to those who can spend $.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999231458,25-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,Terrible game. Once again I can't log in. My shields will drop and I will lose everything. Customer service does nothing except an initial mail. Because I stopped paying for this broken game I receive no more service. Do NOT DOWNLOAD edit: No way I will post my game ID online. Also  I forgot to tell about the players using bots to win every tournament or challenge with totally unrealistic scores  every time.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999767363,24-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,This game is dumb. I tried deleting my accoubtonone server ans wanted to keep playing on another but now I either have to cancel my deletion to log in or quit game ans done log in. No option to switch to other server. Also switching between servers is a night.are - never again it's not worth it no other game has been so annoyingly complicated. Everything takes forever to build. No end game. Servers don't merge fast enough ans there's not enough people or space per server.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999702513,13-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,Top Games engages in various strategies to manipulate you into spending more and more money. When you spend money  what you get with it isn't permanent. You can have upgrades you paid for stolen from you by other players with no recourse to get them back. The only solution is to spend more money to get those upgrades again. This game should be banned from GooglePlay for their treatment of players. They don't enforce the terms of service and allow players to be sexually harrassed.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999174058,6-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,Too expensive to keep up with upgrades. Can't get certain items without spending money and this keeps you from advancing in the game.. It's also a very intense and full of drama and chaos amongst the players..,POSITIVE,0,0.992453396,5-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,During this most recent svs  I was rallied on enemy server. As I healed my troops from attack. My screen froze  a red wifi popped up  after I had lost 400m power in mounted troops only. I have played for 4 years. I have heard stories of this happening. Now it's my turn. I am a keep 36 2.2b power   I have proof of my loss  edited04/2/24  I have put tickets in with cs  nothing  please help 400m power is alot of time and $$ . This is a glitch edit4/4/24 no change quit game today 04/06/24. No cs,NEGATIVE,1,0.997971237,5-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,I cannot recommend this game to anyone. Their customer support is terrible when a glitch happens that costs you progress they simply ignore you. I lost over 2 million troops due to a glitch and every ticket i make gets a generic robot response. I have yet to be able to get a real human being to help me fix what they broke. Don't waste your time they don't care about anyone even if you spend money on the game they will just ignore you when something goes wrong!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999707162,6-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,This game can be fun. Lots to do  can make friends and good teams. Problem is that it's too dependent on money. I'm fine with spending some here and there  but to get good generals and gear and castle decorations you'll need to spend thousands of dollars. Each good package is US $99.99  and big players buy 5-10 of those a week. So F2P (free to play) and small spenders will take many times longer to get that power and the bigs will then be even more huge.,POSITIVE,0,0.994253695,23-Mar-24
Evony: The King's Return,It's glitchy  when I tapped to continue a story it asked if I wanted to delete my progress  it's slow and I downloaded it because it said it had games from fake ads to play  mightve been a misread on my part but I don't have the patience to go through something so glitchy and slow for a chance to get what was advertised  then go back to playing a skill game I don't want  you make good ads but the way I saw them it was that it was a bunch of games from fake ads  seems good for others but not me.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999471724,15-Feb-24
Evony: The King's Return,The game has some great features and potential but as long as Evony does not establish a framework and ground rules for the server linked with the missions  such as time for development VS war  ground rules for attack  and does not put stop to the abuse and bullying from different players and so called kings  is simply not fun after a while and you end up giving up. Best regards from future ex player from server 1568.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996332765,11-Mar-24
Evony: The King's Return,This game is too boring. You play for like 3 minutes  and then you have to spend 30 minutes of reading and pointing and clicking like if you are playing clash of clans but less fun. I want to just mindlessly play the game. If I wanted to read then I can go finish studying for my exams. There's no ads but they have popups every two minutes asking for a credit card. I just want to play where you go from side to side.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999003708,28-Mar-24
Evony: The King's Return,I have been playing for a couple months. Woke up this morning and everything was gone and it had me starting off like a new player. I contacted support got an answer right away and then nothing. I sent them the information that they needed and the screenshots of some receipts and have heard nothing since. It has been resolved.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997238636,19-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,Graphics are great. There seems to be a lag time when troops march and return. The timer will say 0  but when I try to teleport  the game says I have to wait for my troops to return. Sometimes it 5 to 10 seconds. That's a long time when you are being attacked. Also some events are not clear. How do you advance in common rank? I release captives and gain prestige  but don't go up in rank. This game needs a place to find explanations.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997523963,22-Mar-24
Evony: The King's Return,Good and bad. Is a fun game but the developers must've started smoking crack. Customer support is non existent and game crashes every couple weeks. Starting to be a game where your only chance is if you spend $$$$  which feels more and more like a waste when the developers can't even get the game to function as designed. Invested too much to quit but would recommend not starting if you're not loaded.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99949193,28-Feb-24
Evony: The King's Return,Garbage Customer Service. I've been trying to Demolish a building to be able to upgrade my Keep for 2 weeks. I have emailed and opened multiple tickets. Only getting canned responses and NO resolution. There is no way to Demolish buildings. Be careful what you build cause your stuck with it and CANT progress in the game. Devs need to update the game to add an easy option to demolish buildings inside of the walls.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999388695,4-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,Too many nags for money. Packages are 100+ quid 1. There should be an option to freeze account where one gets nothing for timed stuff i.e. rss in city but can not be attacked. This is for periods when unable to play (ill  abroad without access to wifi  travel  etc) 2. Lack of option to open all boxes in one go (chests etc). Opening them one by one is a big PITA 3. Vip item should have defaulut use count set to 1 not to max 4. Boring stuff like patrol  take rss  etc should have button to do all,NEGATIVE,1,0.99870491,25-Mar-24
Evony: The King's Return,Awesome game! But you have to be patient. And build your empire slowly. Or spend your life savings to get anywhere. Still a fun game but they need to fix a lot of game lag during battlefields and svs. Definitely a pay to get anywhere game. And if you lose troops because of game errors or anything else don't count on support reimbursement for anything even if you have made several purchases the game support is a joke!!!!!!! Period!,NEGATIVE,1,0.97308141,5-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,This game is awful  only players spending money or having cheats gets Desired results or general equipments  you have to wait long 3 years to get one civilization equipments  furthermore  the creator isn't interested in solving problems rather just collecting money from players I had mailed several times and in return I got 1 k gems as compensation  so my bet is never start this game unless you have lots of money and time,NEGATIVE,1,0.999599874,20-Apr-24
Evony: The King's Return,it's pay to win! You hit pay walls  where you can't move forward. Takes $200+ to get to Kingdom 30. Max kingdom 45! Game is way to expensive  and needs to lower the price for it's paid package sales. This is evil and wicked to pay more than $100 for a video game and still not have full end game content with everything unlocked. This game would love to charge $1000+ to reach Kingdom 35 and Kingdom 45? I would always say never pay more than $10.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998822033,23-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,Overall  this game is very fun and addicting . It has a lot of events throughout the year and stuff . It has interseting levels each one different form the other but the only thing that needs to be fixed is that some levels are designed in a way that they are impossible to level and needs atleast one or two boosters or sometimes a lot of money to have extra moves and there is no way that we can beat it without those things and I mean the easy levels that doesn't say  hard  or  super hard .,NEGATIVE,1,0.517223716,20-Dec-23
Gardenscapes,Paying for a season ticket was absolutely pointless and actually destroyed the game for me. It gives you more lives but every single level is much  much more harder to get through  even with the boosters which now come far and few between since after paying for a season ticket  this is now the only way the game can keep trying to suck money out of you. I've played for around 1200 levels and never had a level I couldn't get through for more than a day  now every few levels I get stuck for days.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999725759,28-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,I've played this game for years and recently the game developers have tooken away a subtle feature that makes a difference in passing levels and as a long time player I would appreciate it if it were changed back. Normally you could use a move to detonate an explosive in place but now you have to move the explosive up/down/left/right instead of double tapping it to blow it up in it's place without moving it. Please change this back!,POSITIVE,0,0.670308948,28-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,I loved the 1st mansion  the graphics  and the levels  but it started going downhill as the years progressed. They took away the dog show mini game  the new area is a villa its not pretty. They have all these new mini games that were once play adds. The new energy games where you have to figure the mystery it costs you way too much energy. The levels sometimes are way too hard. I won't be back to play. I've lost interest. I gave it 4 to 5 when it initially started  now it's a 2.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999259651,20-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,It's an extremely selfish game; the algorithms are designed to make sure you lose a lot in order for you to part with your cash by purchasing the coins and power ups. If only the designers at Playrix were less greedy . Playrix  make it a more generous game. It is out to take your cash for very poor reward. I don't mind challenging levels  but the rewards ought to be much more generous than they are. The garden shop is extortionate. Someone is pocketing your cash and having a laugh.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99076438,23-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,Started fun  until it's not. I'm stuck on a self-proclaimed  super hard  level without enough coins to keep playing or get boosters. I cannot do more work on the Garden until I beat the level. I don't want to pay real money to keep going. Designing the garden was less interesting than I thought it would be. Mostly it's just several steps to clear up dirt or brush  no real creativity or designing. The treasure hunting costs too much energy to play through. I'm deleting it because I'm bored.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999800146,23-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,I've been playing for years  recently I can no longer double tap a bomb or rocket to set it off  which the levels require to start (bomb) or hit mushrooms (rockets). I am being forced to use specials because of this. I also noticed that every other level is a hard  super hard or bonus level  which takes the fun out of the entire game. I used to love this game  now not so much.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997539759,23-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,Really lovely game  can't relate to the ppl complaining about hard levels and getting stuck. I save all my daily spin boosters for these! And try like 10 times then start using them. I think it's very perfectly balanced with fun  satisfying and challenging levels. I can choose to not pay any money and still enjoy the game  or choose to pay a bit for extras when it suits. Thanks guys!,POSITIVE,0,0.999709189,11-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,Frustrating game. Should be good fun but some levels take days to get through. Not sure I'll play much longer which is a shame because it looks great and the side games can be fun but I am rapidly losing interest. Edit: I continued to play but it's become worse  basically you only win if the algorithm decides you are going to  that isn't fun,NEGATIVE,1,0.999694109,11-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,I used to enjoy this game and put WAY MORE $$ into than I ever should have. Graphics are great  the games within are great! I have become very disappointed recently with the *treasure hunt  games. It has become almost impossible w/out dishing out serious $ to advance when you can only make 3 moves (if you are lucky) per energy refill of 100 points. Also when you do there's another set of 3 or more obstacles to clear in a short distance. Too many special object sets when you can't advance sucks,NEGATIVE,1,0.995177746,1-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,I've been playing and enjoying this game for years  but recently the developers have been diminishing the rewards while making everything else more and more challenging with every update (i.e. bonus helps  points to demolish obstacles on maps and so on). Definitely taking a lot of the fun out of the game. Like the inflation in normal life wasn't enough. ð¥²,NEGATIVE,1,0.930893362,4-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,Updated to add: #2 strategy is no longer a viable strategy. And now every other level is a hard  difficult  or a challenge one. No fun. â_- I started playing in 2019 as a coping mechanism. I've never been able to collect everything in an event  even at the pinnacle of my playing. But I don't really care. It can be frustrating to get stuck on a level  but either 1) I grind through it 2) I quit playing for awhile so I can get a nice  welcome back  bonus 3) drop a little $ for some items.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999630928,23-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,Used to LOVE playing this game! The love has dwindled over the past few years. I am on level 12 985  so I understand that levels need to be challenging. Yes  I know that all levels are beatable and you don't have to purchase anything. BUT  you have taken the FUN out of playing this game! Even with purchasing the golden ticket  and having extra boosters  the fun is leaking away. The challenge where you have to merge items became my favorite and now you have ruined that also with your updates. ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.999108136,4-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,I can not agree more with the  taking the fun out of the game  comment. With the level of  you can beat this level when you purchase something. I can not make purchases with games  BUT I can spread the word to play this fun game. Not even having the option to watch another advertising video to help pass a level just sucks. I'm looking at deleting this game if it doesn't change.,NEGATIVE,1,0.986580074,29-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,I've reached quite a high level but now there's barely anything I get to decide  everything is done automatically and there's just too much talking. The extra tasks and collection challenges are also hard to finish on time  unless you play many hours a day. But even that doesn't help when you suddenly lose a whole day's progress (which just happened to me). I have no intention of doing all those hard levels again so unless my progress gets updated I'm out. :(,NEGATIVE,1,0.999648213,2-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,I enjoy the game but it is really annoying that you get stuck on hard and superhard levels of the game for days on end. You get about 2-3 easier levels and then you're stuck again for ages. I have been stuck on this level a couple of days. Might as well uninstall the game. Playing the extra area  Flower Shop. The board is filled with things I can't use  trying to get things that I can use. Nearly have no room to play now but I can get rid of anything. Stupid.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999539733,4-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,If you love gardens  this game has very beautiful gardens to build. I love the fact that I can turn on all the lights in the different gardens. When the developers tweak the game so you can win  it is fun. However  the game's algorithm is set up  so it leaves you with just one item left on the board. As others have mentioned  it is IMPOSSIBLE to COMPLETE SUCCESSFULLY without paying money. It is a nice game  plenty to keep you involved and very nicely designed. Unfortunately  it is a money pit.,POSITIVE,0,0.936047316,28-Feb-24
Gardenscapes,I've been a playing since the beginning. Loved the game. Recent however with steep cuts in rewards and the prices doubling yet items cut in half or less IT IS DISGUSTING!!!! many of us are very disappointed in the choices made by the game. PUT IT BACK!!!!!!! WE LIKE THE GAME BEING ACTUALLY RELAXING!!!!!! STOP WITH GENERIC REPLIES AND ACTUALLY LISTEN TO US!!!! MANY OF US HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS AND ARE TELLING YOU THE RECENT CHANGES ARE APPALLING!!!!!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.992452562,28-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,The game is decently fun and looks great. However  the hard and really hard levels are only hard due to the game purposely not giving you colors that you need and they don't even try to hide it levels should not take 3 or more days to win . The guide they recommend is useless. The pathfinding side quest uses so much energy to clear obstacles that you can't collect everything. The game takes coins that you won and puts them in a safe that you have to pay to get. The game is not worth playing,NEGATIVE,1,0.998538613,8-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,Sigh. I used to love playing this game. I've been playing for a while and have even spent real money on it. I really wish I hadn't though  because now it's almost impossible to finish levels without spending money. They make the extra games so difficult to complete (needing so much energy to clear one obstacle or 100 pots to create one pair of scissors  for example) that it has taken the fun out of it. I'm going to cut my losses and delete the game. I'm done. You've lost a loyal player.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999219775,28-Feb-24
Gardenscapes,Unfortunately I've had to edit my review  I have been playing this game for years and I am really disappointed with the way they are taking away rewards on this game. We use to get a lucky spin wheel but I haven't seen him in weeks. We use to also get 10 minutes of extra bombs with completing a challenge level and now nothing. I love the designing of the garden and areas but without stars it can't be done and you can only get stars when you complete levels.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995459855,9-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,I have adjusted my review because it is the most frustrating game and they keep making it more difficult. On a recent event  it was just too frustrating to try to make anything that would let you move on through the event. I would make dozens of matches that would result in nothing. It can literally take days to complete some of the levels. Fun but too frustrating and lacking in incentives to continue with.,NEGATIVE,1,0.9995116,6-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,I liked it very much at first. Gardenscapes was a pleasant surprise initially. Nice graphics  pleasant music  interesting storyline. Update: I do not like having to replay levels countless times such as the super hard levels. I can see this game becoming a money grab and it's not that enjoyable to make purchases. I'm uninstalling.,NEGATIVE,1,0.981486619,17-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,I've been playing since 2019 and I still enjoy playing. However I have some issues now. I've noticed I've not has the spinning wheel for a few days? Has that stopped? Also the price if coins has gone through the roof. The pink levels. Why?! They just serve to lose all your bonuses because there is no way such a difficult level can be done with so little moves. So annoying!! Especially when you're on a good run!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999555767,11-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,Good game  BUT ... Challenge levels are difficult with one shot to beat them (which is fine) but if you don't finish them you loose your bonus items as well . Also I feel if there are levels that are to difficult maybe have something where you can get your team to do it for you but they keep the coins or something  just a idea . But good game with no need to purchase stuff you just have to keep trying,POSITIVE,0,0.983902156,1-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,I used to love this game. However  everything is more about coins and spending more to make it enjoyable. Previously  it was easier to carry on to your winning streak  but now it seems that the system made it impossible to beat certain levels even if you are fully equipped. In the past  there are also events to give free coins and prizes occasionally. But now  nope. 5 default lives is too little. Waiting time for lives is also way too long.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997591376,15-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,I think this game is great  in the sense of the story line. Keeps you wanting to play. I however just don't like that the minigames in order to progress are 90% match 3. Match 3 isn't bad but when you are given 5 moves and limited try again hearts  It kills the game. Maybe you can have ads if one wants to play casual  i.e. you have unlimited moves but you have to watch an ad after 10-15 moves. It shouldn't feel like a pay to win. I gave you 4 stars because someone else I feel will still enjoy.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998014092,3-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,The game used to be good  but not so much anymore. The side adventure games are now impossible to make much headway. The energy requirements are far too much to clear the different obstacles. Plus there seem to be more obstacles added. This game just isn't enjoyable these days. I guess the greed of the developers for more money has ruined yet another game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99974817,25-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,So annoying. First of all I always get the ads in other games. It's so annoying. Also the first time or two you watch an ad the game looks fun. But the game isn't like the ad. Even tho it literally says so in one of the ads ( or maybe that's home scapes.) Either way neither game is actually fun it's just color match or whatever. So no I don't have reccamond.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998868883,3-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,Absolutely one of my favorite games to play levels are very challenging and intriguing. The game is constantly being updated developers make sure the game is up and running and operational without any issues. Since downloading the game I have absolutely enjoyed playing this game. Gardenscapes is a must download for anybody that loves puzzle games. The App does have the option for purchases for the special events that run all the time if the player chooses to.,POSITIVE,0,0.999833941,29-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,So addictive but the blue energy loads so slowly. To break/remove items  you use a lot of the energy. You can barely finish the new project. Not very enticing when you have so little to look forward to. I don't buy coins anymore. It's not worth it. I play for free until I manage to pass.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998621702,9-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,Editing to change my view of the game. While I got kinks from previous issues out  gameplay is now virtually painful. Levels are near impossible and then once I start getting any stars to use to build the garden  it throws me into a 5 day  champions cup  and I can literally only accumulate about 30 stars before it starts again. And 5 days of playing gets you max 3000 coins if you win first with NO stars for beating levels. I'm back to playing Scrabble at this point. Not worth it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999727309,17-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,Have played this game a ton and have spent far more money in it than I should  but it is fun. The mini games are fun and provide a change in pace rather than just lining up tiles and using power ups. Recently  they changed pricing and made things more difficult. You get less for a higher cost and is clearly an attempt to milk more out of us players. May be time to find an alternative.,POSITIVE,0,0.899770319,5-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,You cannot play this game without spending money. Every few match games you get one with too few moves to win unless you have boosts. To get you playing they give you lots of free boosts to start with. I really liked the game but I assumed you'd get a small daily allowance of such boosts and would pay to play more. I don't mind paying for extras  I do  but I don't like it to be mandatory and daily. T0 THE REPLY I GOT? I CAN'T GET COINS EITHER BECAUSE I CAN'T PASS THE LEVEL WITHOUT BOOSTERS.,NEGATIVE,1,0.981601238,22-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,Very Interesting and quite addictive. Like the constant updates and challenges  team games and so on but like all playrix games  some levels are way to complicated. 900 coins for 5 extra moves is too expensive. I see you have allowed more extra moves in fishdom  waiting for the same here. Enjoy the side explorer games but the producers games are extremely annoying. Too complex and very very hard  unecessarily. Too stressful. Enjoy the 15 mins bonuses. Overall a good game.,POSITIVE,0,0.947202682,23-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,This is a great casual game to waste time  plus the ability to progress your garden makes me want to play more and more. My problem is this game can be really hard surprisingly quick but I've realized if you make in-app purchases it's makes extremely easier I do not like that the fact that I'm stuck on a level for days but as soon as I buy a power up I'm good  personally not a fan of that but the actual in game is great imo.,POSITIVE,0,0.998241305,30-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,I give you 3 stars  1. I think you should have a choice if you wanna play the challenge level. 2. Some of these levels are impossible to pass unless you spend real money on them it seems like. Or like on the scavenger hunt one really 100 whatever to find things is just not enough. 3. IT'S BEEN 4 DAYS SINCE I'VE SEEN THE DAILY SPIN WHEEL AND HAVE CONTACTED THROUGH THE APP AND I'VE GOT NOTHING!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999542236,9-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,I liked this little time waster for a while  but in this recent update they took away a move option for the second time. There used to be some fun little side puzzles too  but those go away at higher levels  which is sad. The longer you play this game  the less good it is. Have fun with it for a bit and then move on.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997020304,9-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,This game has become frustrating and far less enjoyable. The in game costs to advance get worse each upgrade and the rewards are always being reduced which makes it disappointing. Having read other reviews Playrix's response are so generic that it shows a complete lack of care about the player and that all they really want to do is drive the player deeper into their pocket instead of creating an enjoyable experience.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999818981,21-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,The bomb will not detonate unless unless it's swiped. I didn't think it was a big deal until I started facing an issue. The issue is that I had no moves on the board besides tapping a completely surrounded bomb that was not able to be swiped to detonate. This has now happened on multiple occasions  with my only option to quit the round. Level 5710,NEGATIVE,1,0.999625802,16-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,A very good game. I love the gameplay and the graphics  but it will be better if the developers would do something about the network. It keeps telling me please check your internet connection when i already have a 4g network plus large amount of data. Please if you guys could work on this I'd be really pleased. Any way great game though.,POSITIVE,0,0.996861815,22-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,I quite quite enjoy this game... the problem is at close to the 8000th level a huge chunk of coins are charged just to clear debris!! Like 40 points  37 points?? By that time you've wiped out your energy bar and have to wait to full up after an hour and move 2 or 3 times in a challenge.... no guys... reduce the points it takes to clear hurdles... becoming quite unpleasant.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997935295,16-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,Dear Gardenscapes Team  In your recent update the bombs are not exploding when they're double clicked. It needs to be addressed immediately. Bombs are exploding only when they are moved to right  left  up and down only. Earlier it used to explode even when we double click. Because of this small bug we'll not be able to clear hardlevels... Hoping for quick resolution.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998903394,10-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,Have played this for years. They recently jacked up prices/now give you fewer boosts for same price As of last night they stopped consistently giving the correct explosive for large matches that you make (if they even give you an explosive at all). As of last week strategized moves that should result in explosives stopped consistently forming as well. For example: prep for a match of 5  and it will make a match of 3 or 4 as it falls instead of 5 when it lands.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999217391,11-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,CANT OPEN APP NOW! Mini games?! Almost NEVER. This use to be fun. Now it's all $$ driven. Bonus levels stopped awarding bombs. Higher levels don't get to choose most decorations in gardens. Forced choices & less rewards. Game steals combo match awards like it never happened over & over. Sad to see a great game I loved destroyed by greedy changes,NEGATIVE,1,0.999098539,12-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,I have played this game for years and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately  much has changed with it recently. Most of the in-game rewards have been reduced or removed  which is of course to encourage players to spend more money on the game. I don't mind spending money on passes  except that those too have been greatly reduced. Even the safe has gone from 5000 gold to 3000. Disappointed in the developers. Please go back to providing fun rewards for playing the game!,NEGATIVE,1,0.705197096,8-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,Its your standard match 3 game but worse. There is a set of puzzles that interrupt gameplay often and seem out of place every time they pop up. The game feels purchase or luck based and every action just feels like a slog through a repetitive swamp. Overall a 2 as it was more annoying than fun.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999706209,22-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,I actually wish I did not have to give a star at all. At this point the game is extremely hard and I can barely get past levels. I use all my boosters and I even purchased the golden ticket thinking I wouldn't have to continue to buy my way through the game. It was a nice game a first. So players beware. Also when I invited a friend my friend still has not shown up on my friends list and I was not rewarded without first having to contact support and then have to hunt down my friends user ID.,NEGATIVE,1,0.992376626,13-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,I've been playing this game for years and on level 10 574. I used to love it  but now your greed has made it impossible for me to love anymore. The levels are ridiculously hard to pass without paying. I was a paying customer  but after the new update  you've increased the prices and lowered the amount of coins/bonus items you get. I'll be done with this app soon.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994850814,10-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,I used to love playing gardenscapes  but the changes that it's been through in the last 2 years is ridiculous. The extreme change in prices for coins and the lack of rewards and power ups that were taken away  and the poor prizes in events (only temporary countdown power ups rather than permanent ones) put me in a sour mood. I was a loyal customer until I could not be anymore. The greed for more money is appalling at this point. The fun is all gone for many of us. There's 0% generosity to take.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999228477,13-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,I love the game  it's great that it's exactly as advertised. Only one issue so far is that one of the mini games is impossible to complete without power ups which traps you into paying to progress. I don't mind paying for the game  but never pay for electronic goods. It should be possible to select a different mini game if you get stuck.,POSITIVE,0,0.998925388,5-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,I have played this game for years. My favorite parts were the fun of the levels and the decoration options for holidays. I planned to play during major holidays because you could build up different types of decorations for your main home or surrounding areas. This seems to have stopped completely to only give you the options to build up small square areas with unchangeable items which you can only complete by buying the season pass. There are newer quests that you have to pay actual mone to beat,NEGATIVE,1,0.999177396,3-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,They advertise through a company called Tapjoy to get rewards for downloading and playing  but then deny you said offered rewards because you complete the level quicker than normal. Uh hello? It's similar to Homescapes which I'm well adapted too  so common sense in going to complete the beginner levels easy. NOTHING in their listed rules or requirements states you can't complete levels rapidly. I also made a purchase for the pass and they denied the rewards. Boooo,NEGATIVE,1,0.998954415,24-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,The double tap to activate the power ups has recently been disabled. Now they have to be moved a tile to be activated. Why the sudden change? It had become muscle memory for me and now I waste several minutes tapping on the power ups waiting for them to explode... this is irritating and ruining the game experience for me.. please rectify this at the earliest,NEGATIVE,1,0.999798954,14-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,You have to spend TONS of money on power ups to pass levels. I always buy the season passes but the algorithm constantly wants MORE MORE & MORE. It gets ridiculous playing the same level 100 times to pass one level. I use the game for stress relief throughout my day  it helps me reset. I'm now overspending on a game that causes me frustration  stress and triggers my ptsd. Contacted customer service. It's a high $$$ pay to play game. Deleting the leech.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998868763,21-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,I used to enjoy this game  but as of lately  not so much. I have invested quite a bit of money  too. I'm on level 2857  so I expect it to be more challenging. Levels where you have to fight through fog have also changed. It takes more energy points to clear the fog than before. It's just not fun when you're forced to spend days and days on 1 level. Update: As of Feb. 29  game also eliminated the free 5 pts that we used to get during the merging game. Not worth the download  or the $,NEGATIVE,1,0.999485493,3-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,I've been playing the game for awhile now and still like it but the fact the 1 000 coins keeps jumping from 0.99 to 1.99 is ridiculous and high way robbery. Why is it doing that? That's not cool at all. Some levels are pretty hard but the coin issue is annoying right now. And it would be nice if you got the 3h mega prize and could split that up instead of having to play it all at once. Wasn't the full vault 5 000 coins? It's 3 000 now,NEGATIVE,1,0.998494506,17-Mar-24
Gardenscapes,Recent update broke the game. No longer able to explode power-ups by double tapping  you must move them instead. This used to be such a good game. The developers don't know what constitutes fun any more - they introduce a feature then make it worse bit by bit eg making the treasure chest bonuses smaller. And So many levels now feel impossible to complete without power-ups.,NEGATIVE,1,0.991507411,16-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,This game is the best game ever...No level needs to buy stuff to beat it as all are possible without added extras. Stick at it thats the point in playing isn't it? To have fun. I always come back to garden scapes and home scapes I love them both. Keep up the excellent work team. Austin is so interesting I think I found my dream man lol 11 outta 10 I'm well over level 1000 being playing this game at least 3 years it fantastic!....Quick update I just passed level 5000 woop woo!,POSITIVE,0,0.9996382,11-Apr-24
Gardenscapes,I hate the fact that the time runs out before the bombs you have earned. This game is only good for a few minutes unless you invest money. You don't play very long. Lily's garden is so much better. It gives you a lot of freebies  so you can stay on the game for hours. Not to mention the super hard levels You can't pass for 2 to 3 days. Sometimes I just give up and go to other games. I deleted it before I probably will delete it again.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99861598,6-Mar-24
Coin Master,Easily the most dynamic and engaging of the strategy/collection games I've played. The early stages do a lot to add depth and realism to your  crew   and the boats wandering around work quite well conceptually for the genre. Moving forward  there are a lot of things that encourage and even inspire communication between gangs and guilds  and I find that the community is engaged and in good spirits. In short  a leap forward for this genre. No copy/pasting of others at all. ð¯,POSITIVE,0,0.999714673,5-Mar-24
Coin Master,After hours of playing this game and some changes they've made  i came to the conclusion to stop . Changes on ship parts are no longer worth investing in the app  and the supply limit is set up to 3k and not adjustable as it used to be now you have to rush to the port every now and then or use your resources in order to maintain. Well  thank you!,NEGATIVE,1,0.998645604,28-Apr-24
Coin Master,(LVL 22 PLAYER REVIEW) I've been playing for 2 months now. Very engaging game with a lot to do every day that isn't always necessary  so you can accomplish what you want and run an auto trade when your done. I've spent $11  that's it. Yes others have spent way more and they are stronger  but even if you're hit  it's not much of a loss. Can't understand why people play a pirate game and expect others to be peaceful. Only frustrating thing is season 2 gate keeping for gem advancements.,POSITIVE,0,0.92331171,28-Apr-24
Coin Master,Poor value  bugs  and excessively slow to progress. This game is focused on micro-transactions (pay to win). Very time-consuming and expensive. The game can be fun when you get the spare time  but you will quickly fall behind playing casually. Finally  the seasons feel very rushed. Overall  I consider this 'game' to be a money-sink.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999558151,11-Apr-24
Coin Master,It's a neat game. It isn't exactly  fun  in a traditional sense of engaging. The combat out of the tutorial is rather boring. But it has enough idle engagement and strategic play that has kept me on it for a week now. The tutorial over sells the game hard. And if you build a 2nd essential cabin  you are stuck with a cabin that takes up space for extremely important upgrades like storage  rowing  and cannon cabins.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994221091,22-Mar-24
Coin Master,Weirdly starts with a fake game for 30 minutes with a completely different interface  controls and map. Also cutscenes that look good in ads. When the actual game starts and the graphics and map control are much worse  you get the same base building and resource gathering as other titles (State of S  Mars 2  Whiteout S). More interesting here since your 'base' is a ship you constantly move around to evade others and travel to objectives. Some fun to be had planning things with an active alliance,NEGATIVE,1,0.924421132,7-Mar-24
Coin Master,Was enjoying the game but I can't even play without being attacked CONSTANTLY. It's becoming unplayable. There should be a attack limit on other flagships per day or level attack requirements otherwise it's pointless. This would help provide a more enjoyable experience for everyone. It's a really fun game and I'm in a great gang but the whalers make it hard. It's still fun though but keep improving it because it's a great game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.527486444,24-Mar-24
Coin Master,I played for about an hour or two. The visuals were stylized and very pretty. However  the gameplay was very different from the ads  so this is a typical bait and switch. Secondly  my choices seemed completely inconsequential. The battles could play on their own and it didn't seem that anything I did would matter.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995222867,16-Apr-24
Coin Master,Just another pay to win  where those who won't/can't pay for items/heroes get stomped on by those that do. The characters  stories  and events are mostly interesting and fun to play....when you're not busy being hunted and killed by whales. Sorry  but once you hit a certain point it's just not fun anymore. Want to make it better  allow people to opt out of pvp and just play the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.982758939,6-Apr-24
Coin Master,This game caters to competitive young men with money to spend. The font size cannot be adjusted for less than perfect eyes. in-game challenges grow at a rate that requires substantial spending or hours of grinding. As the map becomes larger  screen updates become God awful slow. They've created a world that could be a lot of fun to play in  but they don't really allow free play. You have to play the way they intend you to.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998640239,3-Mar-24
Coin Master,It's fun. The game itself...is pretty fun. Great concept  pretty graphics. The rampant multitudes of pay-2-win bros make it far less fun. I can't do the simplest of game mechanics without a horde of (I'm guessing Chinese given their in-game names and public dialogue) players sinking me every chance they get. If someone 10 levels above me tracks me and kills me again and again for hours just because they can...that makes is far  far less fun. Do something about this  and maybe I'll stick around.,NEGATIVE,1,0.989661336,27-Feb-24
Coin Master,It's really not a bad game but trying to level up after lvl or 12 without paying a good bit of money is too hard. I'm playing to game for money so I will run outta time before I can even hit lvl 12. ALMOST paid to do it but I'm just gonna end my experience here. Good game  it's different but sometimes a but hard to understand some things.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998149633,22-Apr-24
Coin Master,Your garden variety build and wait  research and wait  chase events and wait  spend money to be competitive and wait  BUT the pirate skin is fun and offers enough newish concepts to make it more fun than garden variety. Some characters are interesting  but the voice acting is pretty awful...still keeping me engaged for now. The tutorial is painfully long and still doesn't seem to teach the more important aspects of the game  but frequent new servers give ample opportunity to learn the concepts.,POSITIVE,0,0.813431144,18-Mar-24
Coin Master,This game has little or no ads which i apreciate a lot. The game isnt too over the top complex. Awesome voice acting and great story line. Amazing graphics and exciting gameplay. Little to no lag or latency issues. Pirate themed and considerate beginers speedups for ship construction cooldowns. Overall a really outstanding game. I just might purchase something in line of upgrades.,POSITIVE,0,0.999730408,28-Mar-24
Coin Master,After an hour  I still can't take control of anything.. I honestly don't even know if I am still in the tutorial and it is actually this long.. but after an hour of  playing  if you can even call it that  I am still stuck on progressing through chapters that hold your hand the entire time and do everything for you... I thought this was supposed to be a huge online multiplayer game  but wow.... nope. Just a single player story driven  push this button to continue type of system  that NEVER ENDS.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998793006,14-Feb-24
Coin Master,Was good at start till the environment leveled up faster than you can. This forces you to use the search function to find things to attack that are closer to your level.. most of the game play requires a group to play. What a waist of time..... In response  I don't plan on playing your game again. I have uninstalled it and will not reinstall No thanks for your time,NEGATIVE,1,0.943594694,26-Feb-24
Coin Master,This is a very good to game with many different types of gaming genres intertwined. The storyline is engaging and there is plenty to keep you busy and improving yourself and your gang. -My one issue is that I am experiencing a lot of crashes from the app. I'm not sure why it is crashing  but everytime I have to re-log back in and it can become an irritating nuisance.,POSITIVE,0,0.837533951,26-Mar-24
Coin Master,On my last day played I spent some time exploring  killing sea monsters  helping my gang capture more territory  and helping some noobs learn and get better equipment. Went to login to reset my autotrade and discovered I was banned until 2034 and was given no explanation through my service requests  just automatic responses. I'm glad this happened before I spent money on the game LOL. Don't play unless you're cool with randomly not being able to play anymore.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999403477,28-Apr-24
Coin Master,Graphics is great! Finally a game that the characters speak instead of reading the captions and in the English way they spoke in past times is a bonus!â¤ï¸ Working around the ship is easy to navigate. The more you level up the more things get unlocked for you.,POSITIVE,0,0.999443233,25-Apr-24
Coin Master,Plays like any other mobile gang game. Very buggy  many many issues. Massive pay wall for play to win. Definitely not for f2p or small spenders. Servers die quickly due to transfers being premium cost and those that can't or won't pay stuck in dead server if others leave. Dead end game. In response to your response  dead servers everywhere because of pay wall to transfer to active server if yours dies from transfers? Pay or quit,NEGATIVE,1,0.999695182,25-Apr-24
Coin Master,Actually  it's super fun. I thought it was going to be another fake ad game but its pretty good. The ads do show combst alittle different but its slightly different that it doesnt make sense as to why they did that. Enjoy the game alot.,POSITIVE,0,0.997997463,26-Apr-24
Coin Master,Game doesn't match ads much. This is a war game where you spend time and/or money to upgrade buildings and heroes and build armies to eventually attack other players. Game crashes more than it should. Takes way more time to stay on top than I have in my life. Uninstalled.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999505162,23-Apr-24
Coin Master,LOVE THIS GAME! I have to commend the creators and developers and everyone who helped produce this mobile game! There are soooo many great details that they have incorporated and implemented in such a way that it all works perfectly together! The fighting/battling  to the mini games and treasure maps  missions  the ports and settlements  the ships are crazy builds!

Coin Master,The chinese bias is unreal  the chinese players play a quarter of the time but grow 3-4 times faster due to having to pay significantly less from in-app purchases  I honestly do not advise attempting to play this game till an even playing field is established which will never happen. I also bet the first sentence of their response will be Hello  I'm sorry to bring you a bad gaming experience!,NEGATIVE,1,0.998918176,18-Apr-24
Coin Master,Pissed. My fiance bought the growth fund after the update and the game glitched  the screen dissappeared and wouldn't let her claim the rewards they refused to give it to her so she got a refund through google play and the game say she has to pay another $20 because google gave her a refund for something she didn't get. I'm out deleting this pos pay to win game and playing something else.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999552071,10-Apr-24
Coin Master,The game is fun but quickly slows down my phone and constantly be attacked by players who pay to win  making the game not enjoyable. The game needs some optimization because it slows to a hault and may crash.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999592483,25-Apr-24
Coin Master,After I updated my Phone to the latest version The Game started to Lag due because the Version of the game is not sycronize to the latest Version of my phone. Hope the developer will have a monthly update or twice a month update of there Version. I can't play normally in the game. I was really disappointed.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999250352,23-Apr-24
Coin Master,Game is good & interesting but the main issue is from last 2 game updates  phone become OVER HEAT in just 5 min of playing this game. As a result of this not feeling to open the game. I use an new phone(7 months old). Reduced game graphics for LOW & ULTRA LOW. Still same problem. Even keep all background apps closed.I even don't have internet problem.

Coin Master,I think the games cool but I think certain items become a waste like the food when you can't use it for quests or for your ship. Also my app has been glitching saying I have no Internet but I have full bars and even checked my router. Also the game gets boring when you have completed all the land and also it would be nice to have a help upgrade ship icon for squad or groups. Also ship cards I already have the ship so can't I trade it for another ship card it becomes a waste and I can't play game,NEGATIVE,1,0.999482393,26-Mar-24
Coin Master,The theme is great. Gameplay is a bit buggy  but alright. Definitely pay to win. Game is filled with trolls  bullies  and racists and report features are not effective unless you like automatic replies. Be forewarned  keep your wallet closed  and don't sink too much time into this one.,POSITIVE,0,0.913480282,27-Apr-24
Coin Master,I'm in a problem when I join the gang then I'm left alone in the gang I'm trying to get out but I can't I've tried every way but I still can't I hope you can fix the problem no matter how you update it so I can get out of this gang. I believe that other people have the same problem  after a while the players will feel like giving up again  an update of all languages  I try to use my language but some are only English  please fix it!!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.998375297,26-Apr-24
Coin Master,Absolutely awful. Gameplay has gone continually downhill for the last 2 months. It now slows down to no movement all the time  crashes so I have to reboot every 10 to 20 minutes  can't type in chat  the boats sail through landmass  it's now that bad that its unplayable so I'm having to quit a game and a team that I was really enjoying. The devs support is awful. They close down tickets without doing anything.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999681354,21-Mar-24
Coin Master,I'm sorry but this game sucked. There's no clear cut notice of how long your safe as a new player. Also  was playing their little fishing mini game and was being attacked  which I thought It was too early to be so  and wasn't even notified I was being attacked. First I noticed blood red flashing on sides but that was all and because other player was considerably bigger  I was gone before I could notice I was being attacked. #uninstall! Which sucks because I liked the theme.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999032378,3-Mar-24
Coin Master,The best pirate type game on mobile. Concept and graffics are amazing  with an open world theme that very few games have. The only issues is that. There is too much content. As a beginner it is difficult to understand the game and what should be the best way to approach it. There are few bugs like the layout system  etc. The game is fun but you need to grind on it due to payers who just pay for items  etc. Only thing I want is to experience the ship in 3d. Great Game,NEGATIVE,1,0.866364658,5-Mar-24
Coin Master,Great game. Not really a pay to win aspect but it is there  you'll need to get your levels up  get lucky hero pulls and join a powerful gang. Needs to add a profanity filter for those that want that pirate experience. Some timers are a little long but not too ridiculous. Needs to replenish locations like plunders  treasure maps etc over time otherwise not much to do once those are finished. I get the map opens up over time but in the meantime need more to do until then. Great game otherwise ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.802074611,6-Feb-24
Coin Master,Whoever created this I just wanted to say that you're doing things properly. It's very rare to find a mobile game now a day's that I can just get on play enjoy the story and not get harrassed by ads to the point that i just get annoyed and never play it again or have it take so long to progress that i lose interest. Or having 20 pages popping up trying to get me to buy stuff every time i open the game  that's the kind of stuff that makes me never want to support the creator. But you id support.,NEGATIVE,1,0.957167923,30-Mar-24
Coin Master,Started out good  but with last update  every time I hit the map or zoom out the screen freezes for a considerable amount of time. Sometimes very long. Too long for a war game where you need to respond quickly. Please fix  it was fine before last update.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994156957,20-Mar-24
Coin Master,A refreshing take on these types of power building games! The story is actually interesting with funny characters. There's so much more like fishing from your ship  cooking  and making wine. It can be overwhelming at first  but you eventually find your sea legs ð¦. I just would like something to increase stamina instead of having to wait and the ability to auto skip over pve battles. Also  I would like the avatar pic of the heroes I've obtained as I really want the mermaid. ð§ââï¸,POSITIVE,0,0.999278724,16-Feb-24
Coin Master,Game looked amazing at the start. There room for lots of improvements sure  but its a new game. What bothers me a lot  is that even the event rewards are behind a pay wall. It's totally demotivating. Couple of friends already quit because of this particular reason. I hope the devs change this in the future,NEGATIVE,1,0.995528877,13-Feb-24
Coin Master,This is my 2nd review. Season 2 has begun. The gang I'm in has almost 100 active players. However  we are not big spenders and can not compete with those that are. Our stronghold (3 so far) has been taken as soon as we finish battling for it. Trying to get back to S1 to escape the constant attacks is almost impossible as they sit and wait at the whirlpools. We can't enter another sea  nor can we switch servers so Devs  why would we want to keep playing?,NEGATIVE,1,0.996551156,15-Mar-24
Coin Master,Had progressed to Level 21 ship  spent cash several times and had to get a new phone. EVERY other app I played was updated on the new phone to reflect game progress but this one made me start over from the beginning. I deleted the app because I am not playing a game that took my money and now all progress is lost.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999761879,13-Apr-24
Coin Master,where do I start I played this game all the time spent so much time and a lot of money on this game in the past 2 weeks for nothing cuz a group of high level players(lvl 25+ gang up on lower level players lvl 5 to 15 - to make it where you can't play unless you spend $20 every day to build your ship back up.cause when they sink ur ship u lose ur sailors. then after u spend more money just to play the regular game again they do it over again. it's a shame the game should regulate this but dont.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999108493,22-Mar-24
Coin Master,This game will increasingly become  unplayable.  The Dev/Company purposely created an incredible imbalance system  this game has turned into a kind of online bullying. Where  for example  the [oMw] gang has forced servers to  die  to absorb each server's  Hi-spender  to move to their server  for advanced bullying capabilities to the more weaker party. This is possible because the system is designed so that its very poor  very unbalanced  & essentially extreme P2W. This game 'll die  soon.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999662161,28-Apr-24
Coin Master,This game isn't too bad. It follows the standard of modern mobile's games being p2w  but f2p can seemingly have somewhat of a solid experience. There's lots of stuff to do in the game and different approaches and strategies to pursue dependent on everyone's personal liking. Although some features can get repetitive. The game has potential.,POSITIVE,0,0.998945296,30-Mar-24
Coin Master,I like this game and was having fun playing it  but then somehow my account came unbound from my email address and I can't log into anymore. I have been submitting requests for a week now to recover it  providing everything they have asked for and it has been  processing  for days with no updates  there's no way to even ask for one or communicate with customer service at all. Just sit and hope they eventually get to it. It's the worst customer service experience I have had with any game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999637246,5-Apr-24

What's worst is even though I reconnected the bad connection sign appears again multiple times and it's super annoying,NEGATIVE,1,0.999812305,1-Apr-24
Coin Master,I like the game. There could be a little more explanation of exactly how to do certain things  but otherwise it's good. Is there no way to shield my ships?? Every time I log off someone ransacks them and I have to rebuild!! There should be some way we can protect them when we have to leave! I work  I can't be here all the time!

Coin Master,The upgrading is taking longer and longer I quit any game that takes longer than a few hours of waiting for upgrade every game that takes a day or longer to upgrade something isn't worth my time or money would gave 5 stars but the upgrades time slowing down game play I don't play games to sit around and wait or continually press a tabb for a 1 minute a 100 times S,NEGATIVE,1,0.999193847,10-Apr-24
Coin Master,Going to go ahead and put 1 star after getting the system messages the past two days. The next update is trashing everything we love about the game. If they really optimize the territory and add gang flags we will be deleting the game for good. They also seem to be taking away my favorite ship sets. I didn't think this game would go downhill so fast. We will see.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99934262,14-Feb-24
Coin Master,I HAVE contacted the in-game support. Nothing is being done. The H2O Clouds gang is STILL attacking me. I can't get anything done because I'm constantly having to fix my ship. The fact that you guys aren't listening to your players is VERY telling. I'm not gonna waste my time with this game anymore.,NEGATIVE,1,0.990592659,28-Apr-24
Coin Master,The game is ok not very helpful on learning what a lot of the buttons do but good game. However I got my wife to start playing a couple days later and she was put into another server & was given the illusion that if you pay the $10 to get relocation stone she could move to my server location. That was a lie it just moves you around in to the different seas in your server. Customer service was contacted  short version  was told tuff luck we where out $10 and that there is no way to change servers,NEGATIVE,1,0.626021445,12-Feb-24
Coin Master,This Game isnt bad  its just oversaturated by a chimera of Mobile Genres rather than picking one and sticking to it. The  Tutorial  is a bit too long and nearly made me bored of the game by the end of it. The text and diologue doesnt always match up which is offputting. Basically  this is a  test it for an hour and then uninstall  kind of game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999735415,13-Feb-24
Coin Master,The game is nothing like advitised as it has 10 different ads. So the game has no skill base and it's pay to upgrade well you do get free speed ups depending on missions.You will go on in a world with loads of strong players that have spent loads of money to get hero's that needs to be upgraded with the same hero type this means spend and spend so you can upgrade that hero. The world is not that exciting. it's all the same grind for money  and pvp is just enough to make uninstall the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999312043,11-Feb-24
Coin Master,Up until this last patch  I would have given the game a 5 star review  but then the game was nerfed and one of the best customization options was taken away in favor of a way to make the game more cookie cutter and casual play-friendly. The removal of the four different DMG specific ship part sets was a very bad choice. It really nerfed game play style and removed the coolest skins in game. I won't be spending any money on this game at all and don't have high hopes for it's future.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99884963,5-Mar-24
Coin Master,Worst customer service experiences I have ever had... what ever you do  do jot make a new account because your old one will be lost and it will take 2 months to get it back When you make a new account the bindings on your old account transfer with it... so no matter what you loose your original account  I've spend over $4 000 for nothing. Absolutely terrible.. I love the game  but the binding and customer support is complete garbage,NEGATIVE,1,0.999800622,9-Mar-24
Coin Master,Unjust and blackmailing When I purchased items for the event and won a reward that never showed up  I had to contact them many times  end up with this   your issue is complicated and we forward it to developers to work on it   ofc no time limit. Now BLACKMAILING: when I refund a single purchase. Made mistakenly by my daughter  they banned my shop access and demand I pay it  so I can't access stuff I paid for such as monthly subscription etc. Stating that the company does not allow refund.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997681737,25-Feb-24
Coin Master,Would have given a better review. But after the recent update game is full of glitches. My character level is 54 and my heroes are level 53. Even though I have enough upgrading material but still the hero level upgrade button is greyed out and I'm not able to upgrade any heroes. Also the game in built customer support is useless as my issue isn't getting resolved. I really hope devs fix these bugs ASAP or else it will become reason for many to stop playing the game,NEGATIVE,1,0.999800503,13-Mar-24
Coin Master,So far its a great game. But as soon as you pass ship level 10 the game really slows down almost like hitting a brick wall and if your not in a gang then your just gonna get your ship sunk over and over. Hell even some people pretend to make rivals and then it really got annoying to the point where I gave up my gang of only 3 people. Unsure if i wanna keep it or not im ship level 15 player level 50 just to get the picture.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999476016,15-Mar-24
Coin Master,At first I was skeptical  you know about the whole ads thing they keep popping out yet no gameplay showed. But I grew curious when I see the review in here. And  it got me hooked. And of course  like the other reviewer said  you started off with  fake scenario gameplay   but  I wasn't expecting that much  so it's not dissapointed me. The gameplay is kinda like  mmorpg auto harvest thingy (except without the auto button or maybe I wasn't long enough to play). Overall  it got me hooked...,POSITIVE,0,0.981097221,18-Mar-24
Coin Master,While it's fun  it is basically pay to win or at the very least pay to advance faster or get better ships. I honestly thought it would be different but with the way and duration it takes to upgrade a single building which so far can go 3 days. I would say it's basically a clash of clan reskin,NEGATIVE,1,0.991699696,24-Mar-24
Coin Master,This game started off fun. When you get to level 16  players start targeting you. I was killed at least 10 times back to back without ever getting anywhere before I gave up. I would suggest they have players die and come back at different random ports to keep people playing or put a cap on how many times a specific player can attack another player repeatedly. Bounties only work if there are any players that aren't kept down by gangs of level 20s.,NEGATIVE,1,0.92984587,13-Feb-24
Coin Master,It's fun  too many of the same heros on conch roles  too time consuming sailing to ports  commissions involving trading specific goods  the goods at the proper level are never available. Love the graphics  character designs are awesome  honestly  those are the only reason I keep the app and comeback every few days.,POSITIVE,0,0.833843648,17-Feb-24
Coin Master,The amount of lag on this game is astonishing  most of the time the lag is so bad that it will restart my phone automatically or i'll go to help my gang or do a quest and it takes so long for the screen to load that the quest is already done. Fix the lag and do something with the outdated graphics.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999737799,29-Feb-24
Coin Master,Very good game  the only downfall is the heroes draw. Most people easy get strong heroes and got 5-6 of them  others will get the same multiple times and it is Cordelia. Upgrading the ship and good parts don't mean anything and with equal stats the heroes will decide the battle. Pity you can't buy them except... Cordelia pack  and be more competative. Otherwise this is a top game and a must to be tried at least,POSITIVE,0,0.991568983,6-Mar-24
Coin Master,It's pretty fun  if you can figure out what to do and what you're supposed to be building  what the rooms on your ship are even for  and I know it sounds like  but surely they would explain this to you. Yea  you would think so but apparently not. It's EXTREMELY vague about  pretty much everything  and I'm talking about not even something to click on to even read. If they do  it must be hidden VERY well because I've been looking and other than the occasional flashes to click  nothing.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997319281,21-Feb-24
Coin Master,The game itself is very enjoyable with similarities to other game however the drop rate and randomness of the heroes has dropped sharply since the beginning of the season. Over 50 attempts without a single legendary hero and the same epic ones pulled with the same hero 5 times in a row! I will be reluctant to spend additional funds until this is resolved,NEGATIVE,1,0.98729378,1-Mar-24
Coin Master,Just another Pay-To-Win. The heroes's level doesn't matter  everything is designed to make you summon (thus pay for) heroes to increase their rank. Rewards and loot obtained for free are scarce and very few  so you'll get demolished and drained of your resources by wallet warriors. Level 22 gets one more boat  so it's just a game of who buys more speedups and rushes to level 22 to bully other players. It's been 1 5 months since the game started and my server is already dead and boring.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999722183,14-Feb-24
Coin Master,I'd give five stars but since downloading I don't get more than 30 mins to play. the game is always bogged down constantly force closes I constantly loose rewards for missions and event due to lag and loading issues I'm constantly running the game in implicit mode while I'm using 5G home wifi and I can't even play the game under my 5G mobile data game loads and then closes as soon as I try doing something over all this game is good but the major lag and constant crashes need fixed for 5 stars,NEGATIVE,1,0.999011636,19-Mar-24
Coin Master,Was great until the update today that caters specifically for pay to play to level up their ships and gatekeep adventure level for people who actually put time into the game. If they put a cap on ship level too then that would be fine. Some of us only pay a little and most likely will leave now along with free to pay. Reviews for this game are going to dip and so are players. Only been out for a few months and they pull this trash. Also the chat system in game is atrocious. No tools for leaders,NEGATIVE,1,0.99955529,13-Mar-24
Coin Master,Meh...its a pretty fun game but you hit a pay wall almost immediately. In the first day of playing i have never run out if things to do...i did in this game unless i top up. Heroes are achievable by playing hard but so far ships other than the basic ones are locked behind a pay wall as well. Havent gotten in to pvp so its pretty bad when you hit the pve paywall on day one. I wont call it p2w. Its more pay to even be able to play Strongly disagree to your response. I play at least 6 hours a day,NEGATIVE,1,0.998239994,11-Mar-24

The treasure maps are confusing and annoying also takes way to long to get resources from anything to progress my ships. Very time consuming tedious game. IMO,NEGATIVE,1,0.999691844,9-Mar-24
Coin Master,Don't get me wrong it is a good game i'm giving it to stars I think it's ridiculous that when you're not playing the game sewer ship can still get attacked and you c9me.back to the game and your ship is damaged and your ship gets robbed.

Free Fire MAX,Free Fire is not as interesting as before because of the kind of expenses someone has to make before getting some diamonds (my point is that the purchases are too expensive for some people to afford) which makes the game not so interesting again.

Free Fire MAX,This game is beyond infuriating! Despite having a stellar network connection  Free Fire just refuses to cooperate. Every time I attempt to start a match  it gets stuck at the loading screen indefinitely. It's like the game enjoys tormenting me with its perpetual loading loop.

I just wish the graphics could be much better and cooler like in the YouTube videos. I get that FF is for low end devices but this is FF Max after all so much bigger improvements need to be made on the graphics if nothing else.

Free Fire MAX,Free fire is a nice game actually. I'd have giving it 5 stars  but it isn't that perfect. Firstly  the network issue is bad  really bad  and the ping is extremely high. Secondly  we play with players from other countries and region as teammates and due to difficulties in understanding their language  we can't communicate.

Free Fire MAX,Your game is very good  but I have some problem of net problem  so it asks me again and again to send its report  it means the network itself sends the solution to me  so I want to remove it.

Free Fire MAX,best game I ever played. afteralll I spend my almost 7+ years without any isssue and such type of games are very less on playstore. Graphics designing and controls are best btw updates also the best part of marvels characters. developers provide soch beautifully characters design and movement and special attacks are very attractive. but a negative point is on fps setting  it does not provide high fps over 60 it make it feels more smoother in gameplay. and the old system sounds and music,POSITIVE,0,0.82146585,13-Feb-24

Free Fire MAX,Apart from all the other games I've played  I would rate free fire max 1st. It has alot of cool features  weapons with upgrades and customizable features for the weapons. Also a lot of amazing costumes and upgradable items to assist you with during your mission.

Free Fire MAX,Was this review helpful ? playing from two years . FF is is my favourite Battle royal game . But at now they are changing old things like new maps   from my point oint of view that is not a good thing .

Free Fire MAX,Good game. Good experience. Good graphic. But main drawback is the network issue. How ever I try to get good network although I am unable to play properly. I just lost by booyah match due to network issue. And not only one match. All the match I suffer the same problem. So free fire player service kind try to fix this network issue. This not only by me but all the players playing this game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996009707,9-Mar-24
Free Fire MAX,In the update you have done a mistake. In PC mode at Google Play beta  the running control was at click character used to run and doesn't stop unless we wann. But now it has changed now we need to hold the run button all the time to make the character run. It's a headache for us. Please  change that to normal as it was earlier.

Free Fire MAX,This game was my favorite till six year but now  it is going extremely weird and wrong. All new events are not the things that players want. The old freefire is what they want. The game is going extremely boring and paid. Each and every event is paid. Old items  that were once very difficult to get  are now distributed free. What is the benefit of doing top up if the item is going for cheap and eventually free. In every patch  new items are introduced  but glitches are not resolved.Concentrate,NEGATIVE,1,0.999502182,28-Mar-24
Free Fire MAX,Focus on improving the game and fixing the bugs and fake damage glitches instead of bringing new events. There's no need to bring back the old items that were only possessed by old players.

Free Fire MAX,It was good until you introduced the  HONOUR SCORE . If you are introducing it  then you should make some corrections.

Free Fire MAX,I am playing this game since 2018  very good graphics and controls are awesome. The only problem is the character skills nowadays.

Free Fire MAX,Overall the game is great !!! NGL the skins and the absolute plus point is character abilities they bring thrill to the match and even new characters are made available every update which is fantastic!!!

Free Fire MAX,I played free fire for a very long time now maybe 6 years... I rate 5 stars but now just gonna go to 4 cause the game still has a lot of problems  but for me the most frustrating problem is there ROYALE stuff like the Evo royale they put 4 Evo skin on display and once you get like 2 Evo skin that you don't want it's literally impossible to spin the other 2 at most it will just repeat the skin that you just got ,NEGATIVE,1,0.994593561,2-Apr-24

Free Fire MAX,The game is awesome but right now it is very dis balanced. Firstly now the game is only pay to win and a huge example of this is the evo guns. And I am playing this game from 2018. There are also many bugs and glitches for example whenever I play cs the game always crashes in the beginning and then my honor score decreases for no reason.

Free Fire MAX,This game is not user friendly because it's control does not work not some time it happens multiple times and after shooting enemy it doesn't take damage this also happens multiple time. Garena company only focus on event and collection for earning don't care about games physics. And the worst thing is about this game is that they give strange teammate and sometimes bot  they should give similar teammate as a player and it's make one team of noob and other pro  they don't who and how player play,NEGATIVE,1,0.999493599,2-Apr-24
Free Fire MAX,This game was better a few years ago..!! There is always a network issue even if I'm connected to a stable network or wifi which is so annoying And the most irritating thing is that my honour score gets deducted absolutely for no reason like when I'm doing my best in a match then a violation notice pops up which says that our system has detected that you are intentionally losing the match..like why tf would anyone want to lose the match and get their rank down and stars in minus..!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999669075,29-Mar-24
Free Fire MAX,This is a good battle royale game but kindly change the things written in this review to make this game even better. First of all please work on the glitches. When I am in a combat with an enemy  and I suddenly place a gloo wall  the enemy literally walks through the gloo wall which is very irritating  my ping stays fine and also this has happened many times.

Free Fire MAX,Free fire should add new images as the images shown are same as 2 years old. Every time the frame changes as per the event. Overall a good game and if you continuously you'll get addicted to it and can't leave it.,POSITIVE,0,0.99827683,31-Mar-24

Free Fire MAX,I am forcely playing this game because in past i invested too much money in this game  free fire max is not better than free fire. But I believe on garena that our old free fire will be back. Disadvantage of free fire max is like network problem in 6 out of 10 matches  rare item are distributed freely  voice on off problem  too much glitches  and the changed the map in opposite of us. So  we want our old free fire ..,NEGATIVE,1,0.993832469,26-Mar-24
Free Fire MAX,Focus on ping issue bugs and if you can't bring old peak in Bermuda Map then kindly add steps so we can go to the upper rooms like we used to go in old times It Seems like this current peak is also incomplete And please remove that honor score system If anyone tries to back the game then that player can again play some other modes  Trust me It will also gives you profit by doing this changes And please develop more things in spectate  for example - player can do quick messages while spectating.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99790585,24-Feb-24

Automatically back to the lobby before entering in the game because of network and decreasing merits points but we have good network ð I don't like it.

Free Fire MAX,This game Makes me so happy but there are few problems the like if you match make it says invalid or reconnect even if you 5gb and diamonds are so much expensive. And the very bad thing about this game is the honour score. I think that if I were boss of this game I will literally remove this score and the ping my god!! ð¡ Very bad it only says 999+ only even if you have 5gb . Although this game is fantastic graphics are great and craft land maps op! I don't have any word to say so much fantastic,NEGATIVE,1,0.99959296,1-Mar-24
Free Fire MAX,I am giving 3 stars to this game because now after playing the game it is not like before and there is a lot of boredom and there is no hindering free event. and which characters? Due to which the game is still running disbalancing and there is a net problem.... If you can fulfill my wish then you can do it otherwise I will be forced to delete the game..,NEGATIVE,1,0.995309055,19-Mar-24
Free Fire MAX,One of the best multiplayer and pvp games to ever exist. I have been playing free fire for a very long time and it has never let me down. If they could bring back the SSA server the game ping could be less laggy and way better than most games out there today. Free Fire has positively impacted my own life as well as my friend's and my families who I play with. Keep up the good work ðð»,POSITIVE,0,0.999472082,17-Mar-24
Free Fire MAX,After this update in CS ranked mode it takes too much time to start game or sometimes can't start the game when there isn't full squad players(<4 player(s) in squad mode). Also hidden world recruitment function. If we had players <4 and >1 we need to quite cs mode. Anyway required to fix this soon for full rating.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998685062,6-Feb-24
Free Fire MAX,IGN has praised the soundtrack for Final Fantasy 16 as one of the best of 2023  and notes that it complements every major scene  from tender moments between Clive and Jill to epic battles between Eikons.

Free Fire MAX,I've been playing free fire since 2020. I love the gameplay. The thing is from a week I've been facing a really big problem . The game keeps crashing again and again. I'm facing network connectivity issue. so I deleted game and installed again. Even so same problem again. After that I thought that maybe resetting my phone would solve the problem  so I erased and reset the phone again and reinstalled the game. Yet I'm facing same problem. my network is jio 5g. I have good network connection.,NEGATIVE,1,0.811139464,24-Mar-24
Free Fire MAX,The game is very fun but it says that my network is bad but it is not I have very good connection please fix it as soon as possible otherwise no one will play this game Very bat think and when lose a match in the CS ranked mode A message your team was been eliminated and then it hangs and did not take me to lobby and then I have to restart the game fix it ASAP??,NEGATIVE,1,0.997112155,7-Feb-24
Free Fire MAX,Worst Game I have ever played I will recommend you not to download this game because there is high ping problem... If you want good items the you have to spend money on thousands and if you almost killed a players then it's get revived using character skills... In My opinion battle royal game should be free of skills and gun skins etc... so ultimately my opinion is that don't download this worst Game instead of this you can go for different other games like BGMI etc....,NEGATIVE,1,0.999708354,27-Mar-24
Free Fire MAX,Extremely fun when played with friends. One ambitious person can play it during holidays with friends and not daily. The ranking systems  update in costumes and characters  chat to friends are all the features making this game very addictive. Thus  my fellow Indians don't get unmotivated after getting addicted to this game. Please be determined to your goals and don't let your focus towards your goal/target get diagressed by getting used to these addictive activities.,POSITIVE,0,0.998539209,1-Mar-24
Free Fire MAX,Very good game but now it have a lot of characters which make the game overloaded with character . Overall game is very good but need to remove some character because there are so many character that makes the game.un balanced . For ex - there is a character named sonia she has the ability when your hp is completely lost we get extra 3 seconds and if we kill the enemy in 3 seconds we will be revived if u have this character and this happens to you u will like it but if enemy has this character,NEGATIVE,1,0.934650958,21-Mar-24
Free Fire MAX,I don't know if it's a bug  but the firing cooldown of the awm after switching to it is higher when firing with the left fire button than with the right button. This is causes some imbalance in the awm gameplay so please look into it if you see this,NEGATIVE,1,0.974113226,24-Mar-24
Free Fire MAX,It is sure that FF is an enjoyble game but I like the old style of FF .Now  the sound effects are changed that I don't like. In lockdown time FF is one of my best e-game. I enjoyed this game with my friends my relative's couson also with my big brother. Sometimes some conflicts were held between me and my brother because we both play in one ID. When schools  colleges etc.were opened  I realised my mistakes and I felt very guilty. This type of happy-sad memories were many but here is no much ð.,POSITIVE,0,0.988352954,4-Feb-24
Coin Master,As a person who doesn't use Facebook  it pretty much throws it in your face to try and use it. Also  the endless stream of pop-ups is annoying as can be. Would be a 5 star game if they adjusted the pop-ups every time you are out of spins  even if you are ready to get more from completing a challenge. It's also definitely a pay to win game. Put $2.99 on and see how far you go. Update: downgrading from 2 stars to 1. This game is trash. Too many ads and popups. Game is filled with bugs,NEGATIVE,1,0.999701083,28-Apr-24
Coin Master,Plays exactly like Dice Dreams  but executes it in a lesser manner. There's less animations to the game and it takes FOREVER to get any additional spins to get coins. The game really pushes purchases to continue play and doesn't even give you a decent amount of resources to start playing the game to get a feel for it. Really disappointed. It looked like a decent game from the ads. EDIT: a few villages in  events start for a player and spins become easier to get and longer play is possible.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999607742,12-Apr-24
Coin Master,I've played this game for years and enjoy it very much. They always have different deals and tournaments going on. It's easy to get extra spins without having to spend $$ which is great. The only thing I don't like is how much it takes to expand and advance your village. I've been playing since 2017 and am only on on level 120. But overall it's fun and engaging!,POSITIVE,0,0.999323845,28-Apr-24
Coin Master,I like it...cute. Not just cute...but easy to play. I am enjoying it. Much more than the surveys! You know what might be helpful? Is to be able to connect with those who are playing the game. One thing I don't like doing is putting anything across Facebook...and my friends there get very annoyed very quickly by that. So I would like to connect and be friends with those within the game itself...even though we attack and destroy each others villages.,POSITIVE,0,0.997387469,20-Feb-24
Coin Master,Not very fun. I tried this game to get something from Rewarded Play. The other games only required that I play for a few minutes. This one required that I build the first village  which couldn't Even be done in one sitting  without spending money! It offered no choices  as far as what to build our where to build it. The only choice you have is where to attack other random players. Once I built my first town  I was definitely tired of this game!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999784172,13-Apr-24
Coin Master,Love this game!! It is very addicting.. The only downfall is that you can't play for very long unless you buy spins and/or any other items you may need. I've spent A LOT of money on in-app purchases and that's fine but it would be great if Coin Master was included in Google Play Pass or at the very least  there was a rewards program for when you spend a certain amount..,POSITIVE,0,0.997177958,15-Mar-24
Coin Master,It freezes up a whole lot as well as it runs very slow when it's not freezing up. I really like the game but I have about had it with those particular things. Currently I have a huge problem with a particular revenge it only lets me tap on of the  X  and they are the 2 outer ones and from there I have to close game and start a new game but it continues to do the same thing next time I get to the same revenge the next time. It's been going on that way for about 5 days..,NEGATIVE,1,0.993740439,18-Feb-24
Coin Master,This game has way too much going on and way WAY too many pop-ups. Every other spin you win some useless item that you have to waste time collecting before you can continue spinning  and every single time you  run out  of spins (which just means not having the amount you need for your current bet  which you can just lower) they beg you to purchase more with another pop-up. It would be fun if it weren't for all that but sadly it ruins the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999783099,20-Feb-24
Coin Master,Too too many ads -> after I run out of spins I'm just bombarded with in game ads telling me to buy more spins or unlock sales or coupons and it gets really annoying. But this is a good game overall! AND PLEASE PLEASE allow us to have a button where it let's us buy all available upgrades at once  instead of manually clicking buy. Because if we were to have a lot of money to upgrade things  it will take forever for us to buy it because as soon as we buy 1 thing  we have to click the hammer again,POSITIVE,0,0.990947783,20-Apr-24
Coin Master,I love this game I've been playing it for 9 years! However they have taken the points that need to be earned way higher than can be possibly reached for smaller rewards and have stacked the slot against you. It's not hard to see the slot forcing whatever it is that you need down so that you can't get the points. And the boards cost so much money that it takes 20 000 spins to get enough to build. The game is now completely stacked against you forcing you to buy stuff to get forward,NEGATIVE,1,0.995156407,11-Mar-24
Coin Master,This game is so brutal. You win over double the spins you need to get a prize  and use every resource and still fall short. You get close but short every time. You don't get very far in this game on anything. Can get thousand of cars for an event and once in long time get one that is  new . Even using points and chest to get what you can. I used to enjoy this game but it is awful anymore.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997555614,14-Mar-24
Coin Master,It's ok if you just want to play a game that doesn't require much thought. The thing that will make me eventually stop playing is that it will eventually become too expensive to play. I wonder if a game has ever tried to keep the cost of things close to how much it costs when one begins the game. Pretty much every game I've tried recently increases the cost significantly in a very short period of time. I want to play  but I'm not about to go homeless to do so!,NEGATIVE,1,0.97221899,27-Apr-24
Coin Master,Wish it wouldn't freeze so much  can't spin  move up or down  always ends up so glitchy and only way to get back in is restarting the phone completely and even then sometimes it doesn't let you play loads to 99% and it stays there. 12/12/21 *Still playing the game but why is it that when there's things like pet food hunt or arcade master or the dance master or whatever it's called you win the minimum offered. It wasn't like that before  you could win anything but not anymore more. Its terrible.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998143792,1-Apr-24
Coin Master,I really like this game. Very addictive and I admit I have spent well over $100. Definitely pay to win. And they're greedy! If you have a lot of patience and can wait for the spins to reoccur naturally then it's pretty fun. But lately the pop-ups are crazy. As soon as you run out of spins you're going to get 4 to 7 pop-ups in a row. And spins if you bet very high at all don't last so you can be seeing that repeating quite often. It's pretty annoying. That's why only 2 stars.,POSITIVE,0,0.579657674,18-Mar-24
Coin Master,So I'm conflicted. The game is actually pretty good with nice art and animations. Fairly addictive  HOWEVER. WHENEVER you run out of spins for the current amount your using  it hits you with 40 pop ups. And this happens again  and again.... and again... and again.. Devs  you need change this so it only happens when you hit 0  once per day... I'll bump it to 5 stars if you do that.,POSITIVE,0,0.996768475,5-Mar-24
Coin Master,Well it used to be a fun little slot-like game to play occasionally but now it's just pop-ups begging you to buy spins  chests  etc  or pop-ups about more and more mini games. If you run out of spins you get about 4 pop-ups asking you to add friends from Facebook  or buy spins  or accept spins from friends. It's gotten really annoying. I just want to get in  get some spins in  level up and pass the time. Now the time is being passed by closing pop-ups.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99927932,24-Mar-24
Coin Master,Wrote a review before  about enjoying the game but it really needs an opt out feature. I'm getting sick and tired of Coinpetition  it's forced and useless to me. Just keeps interrupting the game because I keep losing  because I DONT CARE ABOUT IT. Seriously  there are other tournaments you have to opt into so why not this one?? So frustrating and dampening the fun for me. Let me turn it off.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999473751,11-Apr-24
Coin Master,This is a very addictive game and up until the last few days I have really enjoyed it. Unfortunately there was a change made regarding how to get extra spins and now I am lost in some ad vortex and am unable to collect extra spins. I can't play the game if it just circles me back around to the same ad when I try to go in to collect my free spins and I certainly can't afford to buy spins all the time. At this point I have Uninstaller the game but I will admit I miss playing it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994560301,25-Feb-24
Coin Master,This game is for people who want to spend lots of money and very shady. The higher level you are the more impossible it is to pass missions unless you make constant purchases. Lots of prompts for purchases! Frequently doesn't pay out rewards and customer service will tell you you did get it. Lots going on so has potential to be a fun game but don't expect to have much play time unless you're willing to pay. Currently bored with it cos I've spent my budget so stuck,NEGATIVE,1,0.999150276,29-Mar-24
Coin Master,I deleted my bad rating to give it a worse one. the game is entertaining to start with but when you get to level 70 the buildings are hard to construct because of the high cost. seriously? 37 million dollars to build your first building. That's crazy. And then you have to deal with everybody destroying your stuff as well as stealing your coins. I spent over 2 billion dollars trying to get past level 70. I've tried to get the gold card to complete 1 of the first 3 sets. can't do it. UNINSTALLING!,NEGATIVE,1,0.997147977,28-Mar-24
Coin Master,I love this game but it's ridiculous how rigged it is. You'll get close to winning and then boom  itll leave you just the tiniest bit away from the win every time so you can either lose all progress you've made or spend Â£15 to win. No game should ever have to rely on spending money to progress  it should be entirely optional. Just use advertisements to make money like every other app and make your packs cheap. Id feel more inclined to buy them at more reasonable prices. Do not download.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996976256,28-Mar-24
Coin Master,Absolutely love this game. I love it so much I run a league and a FB chat for the league. I do wish there was more rewards especially for those who spend money on the game âºï¸ After having to contact customer support over friends not showing up and not getting credit for adding friends and a few other things  I'm forced to change my rating. Customer service is awful. It seems to be an AI because I never get a response that is actually related to my original issue. Issue still isn't resolved,NEGATIVE,1,0.998388529,12-Mar-24
Coin Master,Game is fun to play but it is getting real bad with all the drop downs trying to get you to buy stuff!! I have sent money on the game and have played it until work time went to work and came back to finish to get my rewards and they have changed to different rewards and everything that you had built up with the money you spent on their game is all gone you have to start again and all you built up rewards is all gone!!!!!!!!! I would watch spending money you want be happy!!!!!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.99919647,12-Apr-24
Coin Master,I enjoy playing this game - however  beware it is very addicting! I had an issue with not receiving a reward for a task that I completed and Brynn from the support team responded and helped fix the issue very quickly! If you enjoy playing games daily & getting rewards just for playing  I highly recommend this game! There are different events throughout the week which switches up the gameplay and makes it even more fun!,POSITIVE,0,0.999340594,11-Apr-24
Coin Master,The constant pop up for buy more coins or spins when your out is aggressive or non stop pop up's while your playing for events you have to exit out of. If it wasn't for Mistplay I wouldn't keep the app and keep playing. I like that I can send coins and spins and receive between friends or parties you can join but there's so many better apps that offer community play like that.,NEGATIVE,1,0.972672284,7-Apr-24
Coin Master,Like others have mentioned  I have spent a good deal of money on this game. However  about 2 weeks ago all of a sudden I'm unable to purchase additional spins tokens etc.I contacted support using 2 links within the game and only gotten automated responses none of which addressed my issue. I completed all troubleshooting steps in the Coin Master app Google Play Google Pay Google Wallet and my device. Nothing worked.The error message tells me that I have no Internet connection;had 1 til 4/12.ð¡,NEGATIVE,1,0.999619007,28-Apr-24
Coin Master,This last round of team chest  I still don't have enough to be part of the win  I have played 2 or 3 times a day  used up all my cards to get more spins  downloaded an app for more spins. NOTHING! There are no shields given out. The cards to redeem for coins you have to click everyone to have it add  it doesn't select them for you even with the option selected. You keep updating new challenges but the game is getting worse and worse. I really have noticed the last 3/ 4 weeks it is going downhill,NEGATIVE,1,0.999680638,7-Mar-24
Coin Master,As ive played I have found that they are quite greedy. If you make a purchase they make sure to make the game harder instead of it getting easier. Although I understand the need to knock the spins down to nothing  it then means you're screwed for the rest of the events where you are completely unable to progress. New ones come  but you still can't get far. Greedy af. And if you're missing rewards  dont worry  they'll tell you everything is fine but you still dont get your missing 81k spins.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997458398,20-Feb-24
Coin Master,Now it's telling me to check my Internet connection I have a wifi connection and still getting a pop up telling me to check my Internet connection. You really need to get a tech team that knows what they are doing. Plus you still haven't given me my spins for having a second person play your game  now I want triple the spins for having to wait so long for the original spins I shave gotten months ago. Plus there are way to many pop ups. Either fix the game or pull it from the play store,NEGATIVE,1,0.997601449,4-Apr-24
Coin Master,The game has got really annoying and off putting  I no longer enjoy playing it. The amount of pop ups that keep popping up when your low on spins range from 5 to 6 at a time depending on how many offers they have. Also the cost of spins range from Â£8.99 for 3100 spins from Â£40 upward for Â£3800 spins. Total rip off. I rarely play this game these days which is a shame  it used to be fun now it's annoying.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999558985,11-Feb-24
Coin Master,love the game but it takes a lot of spins to achieve anything  also getting new cards are harder than ever to get when your higher in levels also getting pet snacks are no easy task. also get really tired of leaving and then coming back to all 5 shields being used and everything is attacked when it's several billion to build anything to just have it destroyed,NEGATIVE,1,0.998651564,18-Apr-24
Coin Master,I have loved playing this game for over 2 years  however I recently contacted support twice for the same issue which hasn't been resolved. The albums feature won't work correctly and won't open until around 10 minutes after I initially clicked on it. Support hasn't resolved this issue because I happened to be able to open it after waiting a ridiculous amount of time for it to work! Just recommending troubleshooting solutions which I have already tried before contacting them which haven't worked,NEGATIVE,1,0.993252933,5-Apr-24
Coin Master,Really like the game but lately it crashes often. I invited a FB friend and was NEVER awarded for it even after meeting the qualifications and when I reached out to customer service they were NO help. They kept asking for him to email and he did twice and they still didn't help. Just quite frustrated with these things after playing for some time now.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99930191,21-Apr-24
Coin Master,Game was fun to begin with but now is pointless  once you get above lvl300 it is not possible to play unless you want to spend real money. Deleting game as I've still got 12 open sets that I haven't had a new card for now for over 11 months  unable to play when 150 free spins get nowhere when you need to build and by time you generate more you have lost everything in your account and buildings are destroyed by being attacked. Used to be fun but now is tedious and boring. Should be a zero star,NEGATIVE,1,0.99979943,19-Apr-24
Coin Master,I've been playing this game for a few months now and have spent a pretty penny on extra spins! I don't have Facebook  and my concern is that I will lose my progress if the game crashes or something happens to my phone. There should be a way to create an account without using Facebook. Also  as another reviewer mentioned  it takes too long to get free spins  and I also wish the number of spins you have doesn't dictate the spin increments. It shouldn't jump from 3x to 15x. Where's the in-between?,NEGATIVE,1,0.998999298,25-Apr-24
Coin Master,While I generally enjoy playing this game and it's fun  the amount of up sale ads for buying different packages is ridiculous. It gets irritating having to close 4-5 different ads the moment I run out of moves just to do something else on the game. The occasional one here and there I could tolerate but they pop up so frequently and so often with different ways for them trying to get you to spend money on their game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999021292,19-Feb-24
Coin Master,When I first started playing  I was hooked! I enjoyed playing for hours. Then once I reached a certain level  I could no longer complete the cards sets  tournaments  anything. The app constantly freezes. I had an issue yesterday and I was told I did not play a tournament  everything was fine on their end and ended my query. Three different people told me I did not have a second tournament. An hour later I received my winnings from the tournament. I sent them screenshots. I am so disappointed.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997729003,28-Apr-24
Coin Master,I'm playing the game through fetch. Not had any issues. Had to do the update tonight before I could play. So I'm trying to play the game got 325 spins but I can only get 1 or 2 spins cause the spin button don't wanna work I mash it don't do nothing  can't auto spin can't regular spin ya'll spin button don't work. Ya'll need to fix that. ya'll costing me fetch points. Ya'lls update SUCKS!!!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999075294,12-Apr-24
Coin Master,Original message: Hi  My daily free spins don't open anymore it just says open on your phone. I am opening on my phone. After their response: Your message is of no assistance. It's not that it happened  is that happens every time  for the last month. That and all the our hases have predetermined results. Your game sucks and your service is exponentially worse.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999775946,17-Apr-24
Coin Master,I am noticing that when I have 800 extra spins and I use 50 or max I lose my roles!! I roled only three times and all my points were taken  gone  obsolete!!! This is the third time this has happened! So now I'm still having this issue.. I'll have xxx amount of roles and when I go to destroy a opponent  my roles have depleted. I'll just remove this app!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999717176,18-Apr-24
Coin Master,Great game but never get decent spins and collecting cards takes forever. More spins means longer on the game but runs out way too fast even if you play 5 or 15. You dont get the eggs or carrots in time and then gets packed with in app purchase requests. Not all of us can spend money on games. I lay to relax.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999382615,24-Apr-24
Coin Master,I had to remove a couple of stars since I changed my mind of my previous review on the app. While I can admit this game is addictive  there's just way tooooo many pop-ups! It's worse than a Superbowl commercial! I understand it's for promotion purposes  however there are other ways to promote upcoming news and awards. My suggestion is to get rid of the pop ups and add it as a notification in the  news  section of the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998623252,17-Feb-24
Coin Master,After updating the game  which I hadn't played for a while  my game freezes periodically. I have to shut down and restart it. I'm also always raiding the same two people on my FB over and over. Nobody different ever pops up. Also  every time I open the app  the amount of in-game pop ups is crazy!! It takes so long to start playing.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998703837,18-Feb-24
Coin Master,Many aspects of game are cute and graphics are fabulous  but it seems a relentless repetition of  spins   some of which allow  attacks  on other players that you can then  brag  about; no strategy or thought needed. In what I suppose is an effort to personify the glory  a pic of the person (a person  not a caricature) you've attacked is also posted for the gloating. The game is contrary to everything I want my children to practice in any type of gaming or sport.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99597615,1-Apr-24
Coin Master,It's addictive  and every time I am close to the grand prize for the game  I won't dpin any lives nor Emojis. Then they  happen  to change the game to a different Emoji  and then I will be starting all over again. Very frustrating!!! I still enjoy and continue to play ot very much!!! One last thing  I wish I could get another way of getting more spins. Tks,NEGATIVE,1,0.577164948,9-Mar-24
Coin Master,Every time I make one or two purchases I get charged for other purchases that I don't make within a couple hours after making that purchase. Some are duplicate and some are not requested refund and get told that it isn't eligible for refund. Have lost over a hundred dollars this past year. If you play don't make a purchase.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999224663,28-Apr-24
Coin Master,I've made it to village 410 and it costs so much coins to build that I've stopped building. I've spent a lot of money on this game but it's not worth it anymore. The higher level you get the more it takes to get anything and you always have to purchase something if you want to go further in the game. It's impossible to rank up with just the daily rewards. You can't collect enough spins to finish before a new game starts and then you have to start all over.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999391198,20-Apr-24
Coin Master,I've sent 2 msgs to support as I'm unable to reconnect to fb.. I had my account connected but then my facebook was hacked and deleted.. My coin master game was connected to that old account. And so now when I try to log in with my new account. It tells me I am connected already  but I'm not able to Go to the shop or connect within the game. It just keeps telling Me I'm connected to another account,NEGATIVE,1,0.999451697,26-Apr-24
Coin Master,I use to love this game and buy the packages. Alot of packages over 9.99 I bought are not even worth it. Too many glitches. Alot of spins for free that offer a packages that are given are not good. Have buy the next one. They are not worth it either. Packages deals ads are too many. So many token cards and spins are owed to me I spend so much money I should get 99.99 package free. Once a month.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999744594,28-Apr-24
Coin Master,It is very addictive but beware you can't play for very long they want you to spend spend spend.. so if you dont want to spend you'll only have like a few coins every so many hours so takes absolutely ages to complete missions to earn extra spins which can get a bit boring.. update after playing so long.. I have invited friends to join and got my rewards for every 5 friends joined you get the rewards.. now its saying I have to invite 180 friends to join to get reward absolutely ridiculous!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.989192545,26-Apr-24
Coin Master,I need to edit my review. I currently have 10 unlocked awards sitting in the Winter Castle. But there is some kind of glitch that's preventing me from using them. I don't know if this could be because my Facebook account was nuked by meta. I hope not. I would prefer to link this game to a different Facebook account. But it sounds like that could be troublesome. I've tried contacting you through Messenger  and I have gotten no reply. So until I get a reply from you  I'm removing 5 star status,NEGATIVE,1,0.999591887,27-Apr-24
Coin Master,Fun game. Use the slots machine to get coins. Use your coins to build things. Just don't spend your own money. Combine this app with fetch to get free points. Use those points to get free gift cards. Update 4/28/24. When I play coin Master itself I don't win any prizes from them. But I was introduced to coinmaster through the Fetch app. Fetch gives me points for playing Coinmaster that I can use to get free gift cards on Fetch. Coinmaster itself doesn't give me any gift cards. Fetch does.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994977057,28-Apr-24
Coin Master,The game doesn't award all the free spins that people gift u and also u win please fix asap I like this game an spend $$ on it also please make it where we can win more spins an make the Cards more available I've been waiting on certain ones to complete a set an never get them.

You look every where possible to just gain a couple spins when you are out and so close to winning them!! Excellent Game!!,POSITIVE,0,0.999875546,27-Apr-24
Coin Master,I'm not purchasing any more coins anymore and my rate of this game is lower because the game is blocking me from collecting spins from my friends and team mates. It only let me collect spins from my friends and team mates two times after I bought some coins now itdi blocking me from gifted spins I can only send spins but I can't receive any,NEGATIVE,1,0.999717772,26-Apr-24
Coin Master,Wish the wait time for 5 life isn't 50 minutes. It would have been even better if we got to keep all the shields that we rolled because I think it's a waste of coins to roll shields just to not be able to keep them. Like we should have storage for those extra shields or at least be able to trade them for something else like cards or extra lives.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999796331,18-Apr-24
Coin Master,Nice game  easy to navigate  and I do enjoy it when I can actually play it. However  it has way too many pop-ups when booting up  and often says  lost connection  even when there's full bars. Also  it crashes/kicks me off a lot.,NEGATIVE,1,0.757381558,24-Apr-24
Coin Master,Super fun game. One of the best parts is there are NO ads what-so-ever!! NONE. And customer service is quick to fix your issue. They don't waste your time with the back and forth 'can you explain more blah blah blah'. They just move straight to fixing it. I don't get what all the bad press is about. They've obviously never played the game because I've been playing for years now and i don't have 1 bad thing to say. Its fun. The graphics are cute but not super girly. Fun for everyone!,POSITIVE,0,0.98948586,24-Mar-24
Coin Master,It's a very pay to play styled game and it definitely doesn't help considering it almost seems it's set up in a way to make you spend more an more .. ð if I didn't like it I would never have spent as much as i have...fun game love to play just should let the player get to win a bit more often if it's not too much trouble..,POSITIVE,0,0.821796417,21-Apr-24

Well  this is what I clicked on and purchased. But I only received 280 spins! I contacted support  sent screenshots of my receipt  the package I clicked on and the problem was not solved!!!! The CS agent just said  the game has worked as expected . WOW  ok so I guess they expect their game to provide false advertising!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999100089,23-Mar-24

Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Call of Duty mobile is a great fps game. I love how smooth the game play is and the graphics. Each season brings new gun camos and new skins. It's competitive and challenging but still fun. The only problem I have is when you start the game. Usually  when you start the game  it shows the Activision logo  but not for me. And when I'm at the sign in meun  it's has no animation even when I go to the rank meun. The would be a small cut scene of the rewards when you rank up.,NEGATIVE,1,0.883275449,18-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,This game is awesome ð very realistic and well made. There is one issue though  when you die from an explosion it looks just like dying from a bullet and it would be great if you added a ragdolling animation. Overall it is one of the best mobile shooters i've ever played in my life. Thank you for the effort you put in this game (Activision Publishing Inc).,POSITIVE,0,0.99983418,26-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Legendary  absolutely stunning graphics and gameplay  but there is only one problem  I don't have a PS5 or PS4 or XBOX to connect the controller  I have an off brand budget Bluetooth gamepad  cause I am kinda broke  so if you can add more supported gamepads like warzone mobile  it would be great.

Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,(2024/04) It has been fun playing this game for the past year! Crashes so often in BR... Edit (2021/05): crash frequency has been reduced recently however the gameplay is laggy and sometimes when you aim and zoom in and no bullets will come out. This bug greatly affect the game play. Also my Samsung A70 tends to crash when things are moving slowly during the game or when I flew out of the chopper and landed on the ground.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998670816,15-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,I've been playing the game since it has been in development. I have a few complaints but at the same time the game is pretty good. It has nostalgic feels with the old school maps and game modes. I personally love SnD. There are pretty good basic guns in the game as well as the option to level your account and unlock free stuff. My complaints would be is that the bots are laughable at best and to level up your experience you have to spend a lot of money to get the really nice guns and characters.,POSITIVE,0,0.994806349,17-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,This is the Absolute best console-to-mobile Adaptation that I have come across so far. I normally don't plqyobile games cus they just are trash  but this call of duty completely changed the game. 10 out of 10 would recommend  98% out of 100 Game Review  and 10 out of 10 for console-to-mobile adaptation and/or transfer. this also the first and only review I took my time to write  so that should tell u it left an impression on me.,POSITIVE,0,0.915568531,28-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,The game has been amazing right from time but I'm really disappointed in this last season...why does the game go into the default map  while the game is still on  it's so annoying and most times you are being shot at and trying to dodge and next thing the game goes back to the default page before the game starts .I really feel u guys should fix it cos trust me it's really painful when u try not to get killed but the issue about the game going back to it's default page makes it easy to get killed,NEGATIVE,1,0.999376833,16-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,I've been playing COD for a while and I personally love it  but they're some problems  the game has many characters that are almost impossible to get so I just stick with the default; and the other thing is that it can lag sometimes during a Battle Royale match and the person that I aim for is just still; and the last thing is that their is a lot of spawn killing and many guns kill in 1 shot  so I would say that the guns are a little too powerful  but overall I love it.,POSITIVE,0,0.991875768,20-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Extreamly good game. I just started playing COD after switching from PUBG and this is my experience: The graphics are on point   multiplayer and zombies mode is great. My only problem is the Battle royale lacks variation maybe change it to be more like the PC version and maybe a little less glitchy  example: can't see enemy's even when poltergeist is inactive random bot spawns on you. then the game will be perfect. :),POSITIVE,0,0.999534369,22-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,What is the reason for having to reinstall maps and other assets after every single season update??? It's inconvenient and incredibly annoying. I cannot think of another game that does this. Also  I've been playing since the game came out and the UI used to be so much cleaner and simpler  without the game trying to shove every micro transaction possible down your throat. Now it's about 5 popups when you launch the game. Unranked multiplayer isn't true multiplayer  so many bots in every game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999485254,22-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,CODM is the best mobile shooting game  but there are issues. I've tried PUBG  New State  and CODWM. Pros: graphics are console-like and great for mobile  controls and movement are fluid  plenty of different game modes  and updates keep the game fresh. Cons: the UI is pretty awful and really busy now  matchmaking can be uneven  not sure why there are comics  way too many guns  operators  skins  and maps they could do with getting rid of lesser used ones  file size is 30gb.,NEGATIVE,1,0.56273824,22-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,I'm having difficulties with the app first is my resources delete themselves even when the auto delete setting is off  I have to download owned/rare resources and all the ranked maps again with the hd resource too.

Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Insane...The graphics are beyond then what I thought for a phone. (My graphic are at medium with medium frame rate  I don't wanna overwhelm my phone). If you want cool skins for your guns and operators  you will have you grind or get the battle pass. Though  if you want things that are in the store  (limited operators  gun skins  and emotes) save your money as they are about 5 bucks for COD points. Touch controls aren't bad. Definitely eats up your storage for the whole app download. It's 30GB.,POSITIVE,0,0.923034966,24-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,there is not a more accurate description of this game other than: its a call of duty. its fun  the diversity in customization and game modes is massive  thats great! but the lag? the campers? the MASSIVE incosistency at times  because of SBMM or just server issues  that's can be exhausting  it quite literally ruins the fun when those things happen.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999679446,23-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Call of duty is a very interesting game  and it been more than a year have been playing it but it high time the developer make it  much more better on a 3gb ram phone for a better gaming cos it very hard to detect enemy from far distance while playing. Only to find out one is shot died without knowing where the bullet is coming from happens all the time. The developer should at it make the graphics a medium view play for 3gb phone now that cod-warzone is out @Call of duty,NEGATIVE,1,0.992080271,18-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Well first of all  the game itself is mind blowing  having all kinds of different events and game modes is one thing I like about the game  the graphics of the game it's is adjustable depending on the users device  but the missing 2 star is because the game is a typical pay to win type of game which is not good for most people that can't obtain CP  I myself have spent almost a grand on this game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999032021,15-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Was able to download on a different phone but game uses about 27Gb of space  increases due to massive amounts of items for each game type Zombies/BR/multiplayer. rewards hidden in sub menus  not simple by any means. You get penalized for leaving matches  even banned. Frequently hard to find matches in BR. Glitchy  people walk through cars  take a clip from me and don't take damage  kill me with 1-2 bullets but then on kill cam shows they shot me with 5-7.

Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,It's a fun game. However  the cheaters  hackers  pay to play peeps cause more issue than the bugs themselves. At a MASTERY level  2 bullets shouldn't DO much damage.

It cheats alot.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996667683,25-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,After the update it's just paper weight  I can't find any ranked matches and normal matches are with bots only. Fix this !!!!!!! I liked a gun and bought coins with real money and guess what I got   stickers .... don't waste your hard earned money on it everyone. After I tapped on purchase it  it started a quiz kind of animation and gave me sticker instead of the weapon lol.

Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,I would give this 5 stars if we had the option for adjusting game controls for ground war: breach. I really like that mode  but it completely messed up my game play because the controls are the default and I'm used with my custom one. It's hard to kill targets when the button is literally at the very edge of the screen. It's quite stupid.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999458134,17-Apr-24

Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,There's no horizontal sensitivity. The ability to look  and aim left and right is not compared to up and down. It's seems I can look up and down as fast as I want to. Swiping left to right during gameplay is non existent. Seems like there is no mechanism to how fast you can keep up with people moving left to right.

Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,The game is awesome. I could have given it a 5 stars but I have an issue to complain about. I'm in this game for more than 2 years but I'm still stuck in grand master 3. The reason is that they keep putting me in the lobby with legendary players whereby I can only stand the fight to maximum of remaining 50 players in battle.

Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,COD hates quickscopers. Knife is always 1 hit kill while a snipe to the chest or back is only 50% of the time. Unrealistic. No flinch by hitting them either. But vice versa it's soo much its almost impossible to land a shot. Glitches if you snipe too fast then won't shoot another shot. Popular guns will kill you before even taking a shot cuz that's the meta. Gotta appease the pay to win people not the skilled players. Snipers severley need a buff. Also respawn points are terrible die from behind,NEGATIVE,1,0.998131573,28-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Best game I have ever played. Graphics and Gsmeplay extremely good  only one issue.

Thats the reason i give it a 4 star rating.,NEGATIVE,1,0.814393401,23-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,So the game has become almost unplayable the match making is not accurate to the skills of the player. The lag in BR is so crazy that makes you not want to play that mode. Getting to legendary is harder and harder every season. I don't mind competing but when you put a top 10000 in my lobby they always win. Also the game is getting too big for some devices. Cmon fix that please.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998593748,16-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,It's a good game I've been playing for years but what I have been experiencing lately is the knife issue.. the hitbox is so off  I can be close to the person and knife them but it doesn't count.

Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,I like the game  buh it takes a lot of data just to open. I use up to 3gb data whenever there is a massive update buh then why do I have to use least 100mb daily to run the game (matches not included) it not ok  in 10 days one can used up to 10gb for just playing the game pls you guys need to post an update at least twice a season an not everytime someone is downloading resources I know it an online games but then it data consumption is just too much.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999506474,28-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,The game shouldn't allow players to use a keyboard mouse or controller as it is a clear disadvantage to other players. Also  the game has far too many paid items camos etc  stop with all the cosmetic nonsense and put some actual creativity into game play like zombies and other aspects that seem to get forgotten. With to many micro downloads the other parts of the game don't run smoothly on mobiles game ends up being so big and bloated for no real reason. Store is gambling not a real store!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999818265,24-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,The game is practically unplayable when playing ranked and you get to Master class. Takes forever to find a match and sometimes it just stalls and no match ever comes.

Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,It's a fun game okay  gotta admit it. But there is a slight problem. The game is getting larger day by day and it is problematic. I have 128 gigs of storage but still  what about the ones that don't. This game is fun and playable. The COD points are a bit expensive and not many items(Rare) are given to us for free. I personally think that you should work on that. Other than that  it is a very good game. Kudos to the developers!!,POSITIVE,0,0.997408688,17-Apr-24

What i can tell is that it irritate me unexplainable if there is a update and then i need to download all my characters  skins  maps  ect  ect  ect  ect. It cary on like this over and over every damn time. The game take almost 30 gig storage space so far....... Please correct this issue and change this to download only new skins after a update.

Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Used to be good. But now for the past year  the lag on the BR first person matches renders the game unplayable. That's if you're lucky to enter a br match in the first place. Tried it via different network sources and the problem is still there. I thought this problem would have be fixed but after trying every few months  it proved to be pointless.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999693155,23-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Quite a good game. My only complaints are that it is quite large in file size  and us a bit pay-to-win. Activision does seem to be catering more toward the free-to-play players  however. I came back to the game after a few years away and was able to get a few epic gun skins and character skins within only about 3 weeks or so. Would recommend.,POSITIVE,0,0.991747141,17-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,I downloaded this game because Warzone Mobile was rendered unplayable unto the point  that it may as well have just stayed on PC or console. Turns out  this was the better of the two for mobile  and not bad either.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99627775,21-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Used to love the game but the new update SUCKS!! My controls used to only dissapear during armada strike matches  but now it's happening in normal kill confirmed matches too. Literally joined the match where enemies had 20/40 kills and  my  team had 1. New bot update sucks too  literally spawn in and immediately get killed by bots. Matchmaking is so unbalanced and rest of the matches were sweaty. Bots are way overpowered and kill you almost instantly. Fix the bugs and bots to get 5â­ï¸ again.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999207318,18-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,I absolutely love this game but suddenly after few days of downloading this game it suddenly just has a Authorization problem every time I try to play it' I even searched on YouTube how to fix it but nothing is working and I swear to god that if they give an AI response and don't actually fix it I will have no option but to delete it and resolt to other games please fix this bug I really love this game,NEGATIVE,1,0.995911717,26-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,To glitchy even with great connection; exp: game would throw you complete out to your home screen. Also  my code itself was always targeted by a hunter killer drone  for some reason; idk what's that about. There are plenty of hackers in this one  so watch out. One thing is graphics are all right  so that's a plus.,POSITIVE,0,0.97767514,26-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Salam  First of all Big thanks for giving us a good game.. But there's some issues what i want yo tell u that when season come so the levels are go down much and again going yo legendary level is very hard. If u down our levels so please don't down it much. Many of my friends left game because of this thing. 4 or 5 level is enough for coming down. And..chat issue it disappear many of times so please correct this issue also these are basics u need some more features for chat and add more emojis.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998394191,18-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,This game is very fun and might be one of the best shooter games out there. Not only is it constantly updated but it's also very fun to play with friends and family. I play it with my dad all the time and it is very fun ð.The amount of bots. Sometimes I'm just playing and I just join a bot lobby. I'm the only real person in the lobby and it turns out way too easy. Plz make the bots harder.

Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,OK 4 instead of 5. Don't get me wrong I love the game and play pretty much everyday  BUT can you please sort out the amount of data and memory it uses on your phone? There is always loads of 'duplicate' COD files that you don't need but if you delete them it crashes. Because of this this game takes up a whopping 30GB on my phone!! I know it's technically a hand held pc/consol but that does take the piss. Maybe a option to download what you want without downloading everything  just what you use?,NEGATIVE,1,0.998181581,22-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,I would suggest playing this game  but due to losing my lvl 200 account with ingame payment all because of an [Authorisation error].

The game has been wonderful though  just please give me my account back.,NEGATIVE,1,0.978849709,27-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,It's lagging so much  it's changed everything now  not good as it was before. Very angry with this new version. Don't download the update. Very bad. It is occupied above 30GB on phone. Seriously. And it ask us after 4 days to download the resources. Why? The developer should think about the storage occupancy on the phone. Not good as per the gaming norms. Think on it guys. Create script to clean the unwanted resources when there no requirement.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999711692,20-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Ever since updating  it's lagging uncontrollably. I've put so much money into this game  and it recently just started lagging every game right when I'm about to attack someone. The lagging stops  and I'm dead. Every game every time. My signal is perfect  and I have no problems with any other apps. I always close out any open apps and put my phone on do not disturb. Only happens in mp mode. Went to settings and preloaded.There's no reason on my end for lagging like this. I'm so disappointed.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998362243,22-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Me+my friend used bluestacks like 4 years ago to play on his laptop and all was fine. Then last year I used bluestacks again to play it on my pc because I wanted to see how it would be. When I launched COD all the settings was messed up and when I went back to play COD on my phone it gave me a message saying I was banned for 10 years! There was no info given that stated that if I use bluestacks it would be seen as cheating. The game would let you play against other people also using bluestacks.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99684912,27-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Lag is a major issue  however it has been getting better recently...also  they claim to have no bots  but there are definitely bots. Although there are skins that you can buy to give you a small edge  its not a pay to win game  making it significantly more enjoyable. When you're not lagging in a ranked match then getting a temporary ban for disconnecting  the game is great...one of the best on mobile.,POSITIVE,0,0.999619722,17-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Fun game but micro transactions are complete garbage. I have multiple tickets for gold silver and bronze boxes but none have good choices and always seems to keep refreshing to 3 days until a new box but I haven't seen any new boxes since I received the tickets. Only mythic weapon I've received is from linking my COD account instead of the money I've put into this game which is almost more than any COD game I've ever played since Big Red One.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99411869,27-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Lags and freezes. Everytime I try to shoot someone it freezes. It was fun before the lagging. Can't get mythic weapons without fake draws. You will not get it on many attempts  it's designed for you to pay a whole bunch of money opposed to just letting you buy it flat out.,NEGATIVE,1,0.986505449,24-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,STOP CHANGING THE INTERFACE!!!!! I'm so sick of having to relearn how to navigate the app every update. there's so much clutter it used to be easy and straightforward now there's stuff everywhere to either collect or weird events and ads for random skins and packs being shoved in my face.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999576271,26-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Tsk tsk.. Good fps  random game modes  battle royal (can use a new map for battle royal)  and plenty of upgrades for the weapons.. It's too bad the skins are pricy. Otherwise  I'd buy more  and I'm sure more people would pay for new skins as well! 4 stars due to pricing,NEGATIVE,1,0.982055962,29-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,COD Mobile is easily the best Console quality game that I have ever played . Everything is great  kept me engaged and keeps its fresh every once in a while . The only worst part is lootboxes . I have spent so many Gold tickets on   Duplicate protected  crates only to get duplicate items converted to COD points. Feel cheated tbh. Instead just put a price on crates rather than cheating and teaching gambling to new or young gamers.,POSITIVE,0,0.993335009,24-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,So far it's great.. sometimes updates are slow in coming and also the prizes for watching the tournament never came I don't think... there was an error then literally it killed my phone.

Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,This is the only game that I love on the whole Google Play Store. It works fine here in Pakistan on any Wifi network and it used to work just fine on 4G LTE network of zong a year ago but now whenever I turn on 4G  it says that it is not supported here. Kindly resolve this issue! Because it works on all Wifi networks here so why not on 4G? I mean I can't be home all the time to play this game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996239305,15-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,The best cod game available. If they added gas and storms to the br mode it would beat warzone easily in every way possible.

Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,The game is overall good  I like playing it and it's fun. The problem is the ranked system. I was grinding to get to highest rank  legendary  but when the new season came my rank dropped to elite 4 and I'm playing vs legendary. I would like to give this game 5 stars because ot deserves it but ranked system is too annoying.,POSITIVE,0,0.748765051,18-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Ive played this game for nearly 2 years. A lot has changed since Ive re-download it. Bots are way harder  players usually look like bots. The player base is dying  I have like over 100  idk  but only 24 of those friends are on the current update. This game used to be fun. Now theres are a lot of bot players and hard bots. What happened? One of my friends told me people left to the newer games. Warzone isnt able to be played on my device  also its pretty much codm but more br based  stupid stuff.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996852219,24-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Game is fun for beginners but as soon as you try to professionally build up in the game  hackers completely ruin the whole game. Not only do they hit impossible shots  they glitch the game as soon as you get near them. I've unloaded this game after 2.5 yrs running because they won't do anything about hackers. I won't have Mobile ruin my overall experience of Call of Duty. Don't play mobile. If you wanna have a good time playing cod  hop on a console.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999139667,23-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,The game used to be fun... The storage space for a game that keeps updating but won't control the problems or hackers is a joke. Need to stop collecting space and fix the real issues in the game itself. Every update now has more glitching  lagging  you'll get kicked completely off the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999633789,18-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,The game is good. The worst part is you have to download all the game resources again every single time there's an update. And not just once  couple days after the update there will be more downloads for a day or two. Downloaded 3gb for updates yesterday  got another 400mb of update today. That is excluding the maps and skins. Why can't it be all at once?,NEGATIVE,1,0.929040551,19-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,This game was poorly optimised from the start  but it was still supported by a wide range of devices. However  over the years optimisation has become even worse  and previous flagship devices that used to be able to run the game on max settings have either significantly lost performance or can barely run the game on the lowest settings. And don't get me started on the terrible customer support for issues with paid content or the rampant abuse of cheats...,NEGATIVE,1,0.996371508,25-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Even though I am connected to a fast internet  when I start the game it just loads on the 'Validating game settings' page and further a pop comes saying 'Make sure you are connected a network and then restart the game'.

Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Changing and updating my review once more. Its good to see you listened and reduced the cp prices and another issue I have to talk about are the bots. They have been amped up so much that I even get HEADSHOTTED across the map with an smg. It's really not good to see bots do things like this and even more outrageous things. Please consider tuning and fixing up the bots. I mean they are just bots they shouldn't be doing such things to be very honest. It's frustrating codm!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.998970747,19-Apr-24

Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,This game used to be so good. Now all im playing against is bots. The battle pass doesnt look as good anymore  they dont put effort into the characters  they just put the same guy in a different colour The game isnt as smooth. Despite having highest resolution  still glitchy and pixilated Too many pop ups when you log in  have to press X for ages Getting into matches takes ages  over 100 seconds when used to be instant The only reason i play again is cause i paid for skins and cant get a refund,NEGATIVE,1,0.987392724,26-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,30 GIGS? SERIOUSLY? I had to uninstall everything of my phone for a mobile games update ? So some schmuck can spend 9.99 on some new skins and you can get a quick buck? Real talk? THIS IS A MOBILE GAME! Not a AAA game on console  where I have a terabyte of space and don't worry about it. Facebook  Instagram  both the other two games I had. ALL of it was less then this update combined. That is down right ridiculous. Like each update I either need a new SD or whole new phone sometimes. IGP BS devs,NEGATIVE,1,0.999202907,17-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Please don't waste your time downloading this game. If you lose even one game in rank you play against bots  the hit box ratio is completely off and there is no snipers only rank option which ruins the game completely. The developers sell pay to win guns so only the rich end up having fun. Not worth it at all. My review for codm will not be changing  upon installing the new update there is still no snipers only mode for ranked  and melee still does full damage  the game is no longer worth it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999572694,18-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,I've been requesting from development from 2020 for them to replace the loot boxes with the actual body that can be looted  and to add the punture funtion to the tires aswell. That way the game can become Ã lot more intense in regards to a pursuit of an enemy.imagine you give the bike or whatever a bullet to the tire while chasing that way that vehicle will slow down rather than to rely on fHJ or wait for vehicle to blow,NEGATIVE,1,0.981392443,15-Apr-24
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,I really like the game! But there's a problem that annoys me  whenever I play multiplayer  battle royale  etc the hitbox is so rigged.

Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Zombies is great  love siege. A great zombie mode idea would be you have to ascend every chance you get when a ladder appears or quickly get over swarmed  each level you rise the harder it gets. 5th level at the top  (teleport  ladder  or door opens to advance the level.). Boss on 5th floor/ stage. giving it a slightly chilling/ scary vibe I think would enhance the experience. And the 5th floor would be cool if it was addictive like polybius.

Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,This game is the one of the best game i have ever played. Great graphics and great for low end device players. Has a lot of customization and gun skins.

Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,It is an amazing game made by cod I will say codm is still better than the new game they just released called warzone mobile.Codm has low to high graphics and it is optional for better gameplay which is a feature that I really like and the new maps and game modes took this game to the next level even though they took the best be and mp map out of the game for some reason and overall this is one of the best games that I have played so keep it up and good job,POSITIVE,0,0.9997347,18-Apr-24

Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,With every new season you have to download everything all over again. Every map that was downloaded before must be downloaded again  every skin you had before must be downloaded again  EVERY BLOODY THING you had in the previous season MUST be downladed again in the new season.

Call of Duty: Mobile Season 4,Totally broken now. If I empty 3 mags into someone's head and it doesn't kill them there's something wrong with your game dynamics. Absolutely dire controls This game says I'm better than 97% of players - that's how bad control is.

Ninja Must Die,I know alot of people who have this problem and I agree with them that one day it crashed  and ever since then I am unable to get past the loading resources bar at the bottom. I am begging you to fix this because even though I did not get to play the game for long I can tell you that the gameplay was amazing  thank you :/,POSITIVE,0,0.992889643,3-Feb-24
Ninja Must Die,Who ever made this game NEEDS AN OSCAR bro did the voice acting and it's amazing so are the graphics I run all this on a damn work phone ð± just know this who ever did this is and amazing person keep up the good work edit ok ð¯ I'm getting the sequal when ever it launches cuz it's gonna be so good and compared to this for some reason I don't get ads at all so AMAZING JOB DEVS,POSITIVE,0,0.978925586,27-Mar-24

Ninja Must Die,What happened to the old characters from when this game was called Speedy Ninja? There is so much nostalgia by the way I played the older version of this game back in high school and forgot about it ever since,NEGATIVE,1,0.984735012,2-Feb-24
Ninja Must Die,I just downloaded the game and played it ONCE but when o tried to play the game again it crashed and oh god it would start it will stuck at the loading screen Plssssssss fix it,NEGATIVE,1,0.999623418,11-Feb-24
Ninja Must Die,So This game is very good actually One of the best ones out there This could be 5 stars as well if it weren't for the fact that I can't login to my old account anymore because it is a Twitter/X Account Long story short There's no Log-In button for Twitter/X Because It's my old Sign In account Can you explain what happened in this change??

Ninja Must Die,Insanely cool and fun - my favorite app game on my phone. I always love when developers put so much love and effort into their games and you can feel it here. The art style is unique and beautiful  the gameplay is fast-paced and exhilarating  there is so much to do  and even the music and voice acting are top-notch. It's a special game that only seems to get better with every update and there are no play-to-win elements whatsoever. I'm a devoted fan.,POSITIVE,0,0.999153614,26-Jan-24
Ninja Must Die,Great game and all the graphics are really nice but I have to give it 3 stars because of constant crashes and under rewarding free to play players. This game has a system that basically screams buy this and be come overpowered. The free to play players get so little compared to pay to play players. There is also a massive problem with jade there is so little ways to get some and I wish there were more otherwise with that on notice I enjoy playing the game but wish it becomes more balanced.,NEGATIVE,1,0.975025892,21-Dec-23
Ninja Must Die,I starting playing this game from an ad I saw 1 or 2 years ago. Before I knew it  it would become my favorite game on mobile. It has interesting mechanics and themes that I have never seen before. I will not tell more  the rest is up to the ones interested to play  gotta keep the punch of the game somehow. For those who would like to play  keep in mind that it can only be played with wifi.,NEGATIVE,1,0.86627388,16-Jan-24
Ninja Must Die,Everything was good. My review at Feb 2023 was one word: Awesome. Game is still good and playing daily. But I just check the storage: 3.6GB... Pogo is 1.3  I remember one of the big reason I downloaded it is because low storage space used... It keep adding new things in in the pass year  but I didn't expect it became so large now. For this own reason I may delete it now.... I did play it too much anyway. But I still love it and think it's a very good game. Lower it's star from 5 to 4 for size.,POSITIVE,0,0.995557725,11-Jan-24
Ninja Must Die,A lot bug...like i can only play one time just after installing it..after that it keeps showing the loading screen,NEGATIVE,1,0.999723256,23-Mar-24
Ninja Must Die,It's a side scrolling runner. And it's laggy  and prone to crashing. Uninstalled.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999732077,3-Mar-24
Ninja Must Die,good game.. Extremely bad and dumb gacha system. Atleast when you bring transmong  make it available easily or provide an amount so that Ppl can purchase that skin. Randomly pulling and nothing..just too useless.. Devs are becoming greedy for money..,NEGATIVE,1,0.992089987,21-Feb-24
Ninja Must Die,*IMPORTANT: For those who can't load or if there's performance issues  go to the settings button on the start up screen and select  repair . Once the downloads finish  restart the game and it should work fine. I was going to uninstall because I couldn't get past the first stage due to glitches but I'm glad I found the fix* Pretty fun game with generous dailies and incentives. It's a fun running game with several characters to pull for (gacha) and plenty of upgrades to work towards.,POSITIVE,0,0.999467075,9-Feb-24

Ninja Must Die,This game is amazing and it'll be more interesting if you bring feature like in game (mic) or something for coordinating while battle...,POSITIVE,0,0.999710143,24-Mar-24
Ninja Must Die,UPDATE: I may drop another star. Depends on how things go for season 4 of arena. The way the game is going it is extremely difficult for low to mid-level players to have fun and feel competitive. I specialize in helping new players and retention of new players is way down. They might spend $ if they felt it would actually help. ALSO: NWT is a waste of time exepct for asura/unrivaled players in group A  and arena is nothing but  who can kill who first ... if you get a fair match in ranks.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999579728,30-Jan-24
Ninja Must Die,Can't play the game. The client freezes the moment it starts loading and then fails. ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.999619246,7-Mar-24
Ninja Must Die,This is a really good game and it's f2p friendly. The only reason it gets a 1 star from me is because since the recent update  I can't get into the game. It downloads the files it needs then gets stuck on the loading screen that says  Checking resources . I've deleted and re-downloaded the game multiple times  yet it's the same problem. It's such a bummer cause I really like the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.787938893,31-Jan-24

Ninja Must Die,Horrible game. Stutters like crazy and in a game that requires timing  that is unforgivable.,NEGATIVE,1,0.989790976,20-Mar-24
Ninja Must Die,Great game but suddenly after update I'm playing rank 3v3 and suddenly it froze and now everytime I log in its stuck on getting resources even tho my internet is fast and stable. Now I can't even log in because of this please fix it. Until then it stays in 1 star until this lapse of disconnection and unable to log in gets fixed,NEGATIVE,1,0.998749018,27-Dec-23
Ninja Must Die,Love the game and would rate it more  but the problem I have in the game is the constant lag the game does  it makes it harder to dodge enemies or collect things when it lags every other min. Before anyone say anything  I have uninstalled and reinstalled  restarted my phone multiple times and other theories that could fix it  and it did not. I just got this phone and it works well with other games I just don't know why it lags with this one,NEGATIVE,1,0.992276132,17-Dec-23
Ninja Must Die,This game is alright  the graphics and story are good and game controls are fun but a bit difficult to get used to. It's honestly a fun game to pick up to play on your free time. The only issue I have is that it's hard to acquire jades  I wish there were more ways to acquire jades. It makes you feel very under leveled compared to those that spend money. Also the arena portion is very rigged since u are almost always ensured to lose.,POSITIVE,0,0.947148263,7-Nov-23
Ninja Must Die,I really like this game more than I truly realized. The weapon variety  the character development  the storyline  all of that is amazing. I'm also glad that this is even a multiplayer game  which really stretches the horizon of gaming. BUT  one small issue that I've noticed as I progress further into the story  was that I had to get stronger as it went on. Leveling up my weapons and characters wasn't a problem  but the ranking was making this a huge issue because it got much harder to rank up.,NEGATIVE,1,0.963062108,26-Oct-23
Ninja Must Die,This game is great  I used to play the old version of this and the changes are definitely upgrades. The dialogue skips sometimes and I hope they don't use the 'fall in a hole die instantly' mechanic for much longer. Finding all the things to upgrade my ninjas is a bit clunky as well. But the story is actually really cool and the gameplay is so fun!,POSITIVE,0,0.999135673,26-Dec-22
Ninja Must Die,I really enjoy this game! It really is a beautiful looking mobile game. The controls are simple  but because of whats happening in the game it feels like your doing alot more. Im really enjoying the story mode and find myself chuckling at some parts. Overall its a solid game. I haven't had it crash once. They offer their own ads so your not getting hammered with ads every time you do something. I appreciate that and its guaranteed that ima spend some money on it. I give the team props!,POSITIVE,0,0.999739468,8-Jan-23
Ninja Must Die,This game is my personal best mobile video game. It's not to pay to win  the graphics are great  and gameplay is super fun. The voice acting definitely adds more charm to the characters and the amount of quests and gamemodes make it so you never get bored. Th increasing difficulty in chapters is great to so you have to work more for the win. Definitely a 5-star game and hoping to see what they do in the future!,POSITIVE,0,0.999835372,7-Jan-23
Ninja Must Die,This game is incredible. I've been consistently playing since launch. So far  I've only come across a couple glitches. First there are times when the screen glitches and flashes what's supposed to be there. I haven't been able to find what causes it  but it often happens after a bounty. Second is when the game just closes out. These don't happen often  but warranted bringing. Other than that  gameplay and graphics are smooth and the game is easy to learn and fun to master.,POSITIVE,0,0.995101154,17-Dec-22

Ninja Must Die,Oh boy what a game. I had pre-registered it as the graphics looked cool but it's so much more than that. The game is fluid as hell. It doesn't hang or lag and consistently delivers. The game is easy to pick up  fun to play  has the right amount of grind and has pretty good rewards for a F2P player. The levels are beautifully designed and the skill system is also very well made but not too complex. Honestly it's a must try. Good work devs!,POSITIVE,0,0.99980253,1-Mar-23

Ninja Must Die,It's a really fun game  but the match making system for the tournaments is really bad. I was a pretty low level and got paired with a very high-level player.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999276936,11-Dec-23
Ninja Must Die,Awesome game especially for the phone. What sucked me in the most was the cut scene/ gameplay animation and The Music(Love the Music). It moves so smoothly and with the proper sound system (i.e. JBL portable speaker) it is very easy to sit and play for hours. Some highlights are Riding ur Dragon or shooting thru Portals the controls are easily learned. I Love there are no Ads its a legit game! I know I'll eventually have to spend some dough I won't even mind as long as the GAME STAYS THIS GOOD!,POSITIVE,0,0.999208748,7-Jan-23
Ninja Must Die,It took me a moment to realise it but  I use to play this game about a decade ago  and I'm absolutely stunned with the updates this game has undergone since then. There's new beautiful visuals  a story  cutscenes with voice acting  a chat system  and so much more. The core gameplay being an 2D runner has stayed but you now have super attacks  different weapons  and boss battles. I absolutely recommend playing this game  and I'm certainly keeping this game on my phone.,POSITIVE,0,0.999617577,17-May-23
Ninja Must Die,This game was absolutely amazing the graphics were incredible and I love how creative it is.The game is also completly as free and is not laggy at all. Really recommend for people who hate adds and love adventure game. So 5 stars no doubt,POSITIVE,0,0.999699235,6-Jan-24
Ninja Must Die,This is one of my most favorite mobile games ever. The design is great  the game is very fun with steadily increasing difficulty  and there's no pay wall so far. I've gotten to Super Ninja III and am still having a great time. Also  there are no ads at all. No forced or even optional ads. You just don't see that in a free mobile game  ever. I highly recommend this game.,POSITIVE,0,0.9996382,21-Feb-23
Ninja Must Die,Wonderful game! The art is amazing  the gameplay is simple yet addicting  the VA is soo good. One thing I love about this game is the race mode  which has a leaderboard. It makes playing better and more challenging because someone else can beat your score anytime. The story is interesting as well. I hope you guys add more modes in the future. I think adding co-op mode is possible for this game. Anyway  a very fun game that I totally recommend playing.,POSITIVE,0,0.999805152,14-Jan-23
Ninja Must Die,I downloaded this on a whim  but now it's something I play on a daily basis. The dailies are fun. The community is great  there are lots of different bosses to fight  there's multiple game modes to play. Overall  it just feels like a wonderful experience and even without putting any money into it  you can have a lot of fun and upgrade your character pretty quickly. Definitely a must-play. If you enjoy those games where you kind of run and dodge stuff. It's a nice take on it with combat.,POSITIVE,0,0.999811947,9-Feb-23
Ninja Must Die,Always love my Shinobi games. Tenchu  Naruto  sekiro etc. I normally don't download games to my phone and this particular game was just to pass some time  however I can't get enough of this game  the graphics are great  different characters with different abilities  different villains  the ability to level up your character and get specific titles and more.. the only thing I wish it this game had is the ability to use a weapon freely as the ability to dash and jump. 10/10 regardless.,NEGATIVE,1,0.96211195,22-Dec-22
Ninja Must Die,I gotta say  this game is absolutely incredible. Especially for a mobile game. The visuals are beautiful  the music slaps  and the story/cut scenes are awesome! The game play is super fun and addicting as well. The icing on the cake was the option to switch from the English voice actors to the Japanese version. Give the game a try! You won't regret it.,POSITIVE,0,0.999852538,29-Jan-23

Royal Match,Its just such a satisfying game  it keeps giving   the more you win on levels the more you gain   and those purple power balls   the damage they do and how much you can collect with them. Again so satisfying  you just find yourself playing for ages   and honestly it's the only game I don't mind spending money on  because of how much progression you can do with spending.,POSITIVE,0,0.998797178,29-Apr-24
Royal Match,It's a great game  but the only reason I haven't given it a five is... It's gives the impression that it's going to finish at one point  once you have completed all the areas  well done you've smashed it.. have a tour of what you've built... Some official like certificate to say we have officially completed it etc... BUT NOOOOOO They do this thing once you've completed all the levels called the royal pass  which does no even add to the star count towards the next level. Gd game but no closure,NEGATIVE,1,0.997866094,27-Apr-24
Royal Match,I hate falsely advertised games I wish I could give you a negative 1000 stars. Stop showing things that you have to get to level 1 million for it to look like the ad  that made me get the game in the first place. ( Which is the reason I chose it) Let fire rain and water fall and let me figure out the puzzle to save the king. Never trusting you people again. Y'all a waste of space.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999541163,27-Apr-24
Royal Match,Royal Match has no ads. It's not impossible to clear levels without in app purchase. It takes strategy to pass certain levels. A very rewarding game with no glitches. What you see is what you get. I hv been playing since 2021. Thank you to the creators of this game. It's a pleasure to play and a great way to keep you mentally stimulated.,POSITIVE,0,0.999790847,29-Apr-24
Royal Match,Like all match games  you can tell exactly when the designers got tired of creating levels. Suddenly none of the things you need drop in  nothing matches  items have to shuffle around because the algorithm prioritized failure over fair odds. I wonder if anyone will ever create a match game that just uses RNG instead of a skewed  money-generating  pseudo-fair algorithm.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999571264,28-Apr-24
Royal Match,This is just another match game. I downloaded it because the  save the king  ads looked fun. Turns out this is exactly like all the rest of the matching games. The games of saving the king from something only happen once every 15-20 levels  maybe. The less rest of the levels are all the standard  candy crush  system. It's not a bad game  but it's also nothing special  and I'm so tired of these games advertising something different  only to be the same old  same old.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999379277,27-Mar-24
Royal Match,No ads! No constantly annoying you to comment or watch videos. The game is not hard but it's not easy either. Some level actually made me have to played several times to get it right. You mainly play the matching game to get star to basically decorate the castle and different rooms within it. Once in a while  you will actually play mini game to save the king which is also matching but it will be aiming to save the king. LOVE THAT IT HAS NO ADS!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.99347949,22-Apr-24
Royal Match,Not what I expected  very different from the ad. It's just a normal swapping and matching game like candy crush. The challenges comes after 10-20 normal games. So why's the advert so based on saving the king????? I'm of the opinion that the game should be more of those  saving the king  challenges which is the only thing that makes it unique and different from other swapping and matching games. I'm disappointed â¹ï¸,NEGATIVE,1,0.999732077,26-Apr-24
Royal Match,I have downloaded this game few days back and true to their words  there are absolutely no ads. Not even a single one. But that means  you can't get extra moves for level by watching ad and have to sacrifice 900 coins every time  if you need just 1 or 2 more moves to clear the level. 900  imo  is way too much. I am stuck at level 371 right now  and the levels are becoming increasingly difficult. But the game is great  addictive and enjoyable.,POSITIVE,0,0.995831788,8-Mar-24
Royal Match,Don't get sucked in. Some levels are well over 100 tries. Bonus levels to get coin become sparse. *games* to get boosters are impossible to get through as you have to beat levels on your 1st attempt repeatedly in order to win anything. It's a money grab after hitting a certain level. Currently been stuck on one level for a week. This game is a joke. Play a level enough they will give you more moves than you started with if you have the money to continue. I wish I could post screenshots,NEGATIVE,1,0.9954319,26-Apr-24
Royal Match,I'm on level 819 and honestly I guess I'm going to dump my power ups on it and uninstall. First it felt like there was way too much going on at once and I was advancing almost too fast. It never got to a comfortable pace. Now every level is a dead stop  and so hard to get more lives. Very few save the king levels  which was honestly the best. I would have rather just done those nonstop.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998317957,24-Apr-24
Royal Match,Great game to play. For as long as it lets you. Impossible to waste 30mins whenever you like. Can't kill a train journey or anything unless it feels like letting you. This can be frustrating as you might just be getting into a level and enjoying yourself when you run out of lives. Good game but annoying.,POSITIVE,0,0.991729915,28-Apr-24
Royal Match,Every ad I've ever saw for this game is saving the kind by matching. Annoyingly after downloading I learned that it is like every other matching game out there and saving the king levels are very few and far between. I've played 17 levels now and only got one level to save the king called   The Kings Nightmare . The makers really need to fix their ad as it is very misguided and only shows the mini games that are too few between the regular matching levels ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.999594152,2-Apr-24
Royal Match,LISTEN TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS! This is nothing like the ads where you try to save the King. All the ads and previews are extremely misleading. Its just a match game where the only way you can advance is to spend 100's of dollars. Once you reach a certain level the game is unplayable  will probably uninstall since all it's good for is taking up space on my phone now.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999756753,16-Apr-24
Royal Match,I echo the negative comments about the game becoming virtually impossible to win without a purchase. Also  I find it statistically impossible for the power up light 99% of the time to be given on a hard or super hard level  which almost always kills the power up in one game. I no longer enjoy playing this game feeling like it's just out to generate purchases at almost every level  even the so called easy levels.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999567688,26-Mar-24
Royal Match,Out of the gate - it's not the game play that advertised. There is no saving the king as advertised and that's afyer playing this to 213 levels. It's a no skill game that eventually increases in difficulty until you have no choice but to pay for the upgrades needed to complete the levels. Additionally  you only get so many tried before it makes you wait a half hour to play again. It's just too cheesy of a game to also be this lame.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999730051,14-Apr-24
Royal Match,This game was good in the beginning  but it became hard  like very hard which is impossible to finish. I have been playing a level for two days and still can't pass it.Why is it like this??? May be just to make money..so you can't finish a level buy more moves or booms.YlThis is called cheating.And above all you cant report any mistakes done by the programmer. This is why I am giving it only one star.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999401093,19-Apr-24
Royal Match,It's very addictive  great there are no ads too  but also so frustrating when time after time you don't even come close to beating a level. Then bingo! 100 tries later you blitz it with moves to spare. Then after all that you manage to beat 10 levels and earn the 'super light ball'. That's great you have now got a better chance  but the next level is super hard and takes it away when you fail. Sorry but I won't be tempted to spend money to progress.,POSITIVE,0,0.581272066,25-Mar-24
Royal Match,Geez. If you are expecting to save the king you will be disappointed. Oh there us a few side games to do thus but few. Then you play and get to the point that you cannot win without spending money. So between the two I'm just going to delete the game and look elsewhere though it appears most of the games are like this. False advertising and rigging thr game to spend money. Not going to do it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999749959,7-Apr-24
Royal Match,Very disappointed. The adds for this game show rescuing the king from various perils when the reality is that it is just another match 3 game. I have been playing this for 6 plus months and have only had 2  rescue  games. False advertising! Edit to add  another several months and levels  and still no  rescues . I will be deleting this game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999674559,2-Apr-24
Royal Match,This game is disgustingly fun. My dissatisfaction comes with the pay to play mentality. It's almost as if the developers forgot how to have fun. A puzzle that shouldn't be difficult suddenly is  and the option to buy buy buy is before you. I play another match 3 game by Zynga who used to operate this way  but have since changed to a more player friendly format. There are more chances to gain power ups and infinite time; there are more rewards of higher value. This game is good but it needs work.,NEGATIVE,1,0.983347714,26-Apr-24
Royal Match,Fun  addictive and NO ADS! The level difficulty fluctuates. You don't actually have to save the King like the ads. It'd only about every 8-10 levels do you save him and you can skip it. I'm at level 622. It's a match and destroy game like Candy Crush but no ads!,NEGATIVE,1,0.996804476,29-Apr-24
Royal Match,Relatively fun until you get to levels that are designed to make you lose. From there  you either spend money to keep from losing a streak or you're stuck on it for the the next three days. Even if you have enough coins to get through that level  it is almost always certain you'll face the same problem next level. Like I said  relatively fun and easy  but blatantly aggravating that that's how it works.,POSITIVE,0,0.703710079,30-Mar-24
Royal Match,Typical of these games eventually you hit that wall where every level becomes almost impossible to win without spending money. I will say granted this one it took longer than others but around level 1000 it hits you. The game had a nice progression going for awhile too. Just enough difficulty and challenge to keep you coming back then boom level 1000 the difficulty jumps like 500% essentially making winning impossible without paying. So time to uninstall.,POSITIVE,0,0.981654763,16-Apr-24
Royal Match,I gave this game my very best  but alas it just wasn't satisfactory. It possesses some redeeming qualities like having no ads  but that isn't enough to save it from what is essentially 50% based on luck. And when I become stuck simply because the game decides to not give me what I need to progress without becoming a pay to win  it no longer becomes fun. I'm sorry  but i cannot recommend this game to anyone else. ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.999098182,15-Apr-24
Royal Match,The developer tricked us. Why deceit? You could have just showed d game for how it really is which is just a regular match game. I only downloaded it because the SAVE THE KING ads were really catchy . I was expecting the king to be in danger in all levels or most but it's just about matching tiles in different areas. BORINGGGGGGG! PLEASE DO BETTER than such a deceitful ad next time so people can find your game authentic and nice. It may not be bad but nothing special and i can't stand deceit.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998929083,3-Apr-24
Royal Match,Candy crash clone. Same issues. Sometimes you just stuck on a level  because of the system decides to stuck there. You can use as much boost you want. You stay there. Then suddenly after a few days  you solve it straight. Uninstalled. I won't need this. Thanks.,NEGATIVE,1,0.98711127,25-Apr-24
Royal Match,I'm at level 8301 and playing the crown games or whatever it is called. The game was really fun at one point. However  the idea of spending a day trying to complete a level is exhausting and more of a headache than a good time. I have spent money on this game a few times but at this point I would have to constantly spend money to reach a goal. I am not willing to do that. With that being said  despite the misleading ads for this game  it is fun  but only until you reach a certain level.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994488358,21-Apr-24
Royal Match,The bells and whistles of RM are fantastic. The graphics pop as well. Unfortunately this game requires $'s to complete higher levels. Otherwise  you can get stuck for hours playing the same game. After reading a few dozen reviews  I can't help but think the 4.6 rating doesn't seem plausible.,NEGATIVE,1,0.989693224,20-Apr-24
Royal Match,Again just like any other mobile game. You get to a point where you need to buy all these extra bombs and what not to be able to have a chance to beat the level. Also you have lives. lose 5 matches and wait 15 minutes per life or you can purchase via coins. Again coins can also be bought  go figure... or you can earn them. and earning them feels like you've got a job in a third world country. You can save up for 40 levels and be able to refill 3 times. Tbh just save up for a console and switch.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994458556,25-Apr-24
Royal Match,I like it but .. there's a couple things that I wish they would do for this game. The most important one is when you lose a level you can't see the board. Like you can either continue with 900 coins which is too expensive that's the other thing but they don't show you what you had left. The other thing is when you get the super light balls.. give infinity light balls for 15 minutes. I got them and lose them right away!,NEGATIVE,1,0.995006442,15-Apr-24
Royal Match,Makes you fail levels over and over again so you buy points and power ups. A level should be possible to pass every time some harder but should be passable but its not  all dictated by royal match software to the point you spend money or just uninstall like myself. As a bit strange as soon as i spend a little money i pass the level ive been stuck on for the last 6 hours. Doesnt play fairly its a manipulated game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998702526,17-Apr-24
Royal Match,It's not like the ad. It's only about saving the King once in a while. It's more about clicking coloured tiles and clearing the level. Graphics are excellent. But otherwise very ordinary. Around level 16 it gets hard unless you spend money and then skies the limit. Ads are long and annoying as all these games are....,NEGATIVE,1,0.993923128,19-Apr-24
Royal Match,I really loved this game at first! No ads  fun  good challenge  and team collaboration. As I advanced the levels got harder and harder  as expected. However  the upper levels are unwinnable without a ton of boosters and coins to buy extra moves. Since these are only earned by advancing  players are forced to purchase booster/coin packs. I don't mind spending a bit of money on entertainment but a game is no fun if buying extras is the only way to advance. I'm sad to say I'll be uninstalling.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99695766,29-Mar-24
Royal Match,I feel cheated. I downloaded this game because it looked awesome and different on the adverts. I thought you had to save the king by solving puzzles. Although those levels do exist  they are rare and nearly all the other levels are just a standard match game. Really disappointed by thisz the advertising is misleading so I am now uninstalling. If you made the game where every level was saving the king  you would have the best pizzle game ever.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999486804,24-Feb-24
Royal Match,It's rigged against you. It gets to a point where it takes days  yes  days to beat a level without buying a pack or using an ingame add-on to beat the level. You'll find yourself saying... No way  a lot. Spare yourself the frustration don't install it. It's free of adds for a reason. It's taken me 2.6k levels of frustration to get to this point. I'm done playing this. Deleting after this. Wake up developers.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999606311,17-Apr-24
Royal Match,The game is fun to begin with  but after a while the levels get so difficult you get stuck there for ages. Payout for winning a level is 20-30ð° but 5 extra moves will cost you 900bucks  an additional 5 moves sets you back 1900bucks (plus the first 900ð°). Every time you loose a level all your earnings gets taken from you and you start from scratch with nothing  making most levels impossible to win and gives you an unfair chance while competing against others with 3 x powerups etc. Uninstalling!,NEGATIVE,1,0.991862893,20-Apr-24
Royal Match,Updated review: Stuck on level 499. Why? Broken mechanics and not enough moves. Game just progressively gets harder and harder  and if you don't have luck  power ups or enough gold for continues  you're just gonna get stuck. 900 gold for the first continue is way too steep for the amount of gold you actually get from playing the game  and the power-ups are also all way too expensive  especially when it comes to certain level designs where none of the powers help  except the hammer.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999748647,4-Apr-24
Royal Match,Disgusted! The only way to complete upper levels is to constantly make in app purchases  which quite frankly has completely ruined the experience for me. I was enjoying this game  but now I'm close to uninstalling it. It's simply not fair. I feel sorry for younger players whose parents are expected to fit the bill for their childs enjoyment. Please please please.. make the levels at least completable without having to pay a fortune for the experience!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999632716,16-Apr-24
Royal Match,Don't ever pay for anything on this app. The algorithm will then do nothing but suck you dry to keep you paying. You'll clear all but one item on a board and magically get a magic light ball after your last play to entice you to buy coins. You'll be on boards that you have tried 50 times and can't pass  only to magically one time pass it with 10 moves left. The creator doesn't even try to make their money sucking tactics discreet.,POSITIVE,0,0.749577045,22-Apr-24
Royal Match,great game  great graphics. my complaint is 900 is a too much to play on. considering you're lucky to get 30 in the game when it's finished. yes I know the game will let you eventually get through the level  but still 900 for 5 extra plays is too much. other than that I love the game. I love kings nightmare  I also love how some things are animated.,POSITIVE,0,0.861110687,25-Apr-24
Royal Match,The first 100 was enjoyable! I am now at 400 above ( probably 3 000 attempts to get above 400 wins ) it's getting to be very hard to level up unless you spend $$$. Trust me  you need lots of MONEY to level up !!! The game is designed to not let you win unless you buy their coins,NEGATIVE,1,0.984707177,21-Apr-24
Royal Match,It's because of no ads that I gave 2 stars. But the way the game played you it's a rigged.We all know this is a luck game.At first its ok  task were easy and the way the items were arrange are playable.But when you get to the higher level like above 1k  you might end up empty boosters  coins and waste your time because the task need to accomplished is 4 times the moves given.Even if you use your booster still barely make it unless you spend coins just to get through it. Candy crash still better.,NEGATIVE,1,0.989975274,25-Apr-24
Royal Match,For anyone reading this: this game is great fun and addictive. But be warned  some levels are ridiculous to try and complete  and you'll be stuck repeating them for literal days  exhausting every power up and coin you've accumulated until the algorithm kicks in and let's you beat it just to prevent you from getting completely disinterested. If you're willing to tolerate that  then it can be a fun time waster.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996910155,10-Mar-24
Royal Match,Game is fun at first then puzzles cheat with obstacles you can't solve without using power ups from the start. They hook players in by feeling good and fast progression then ramp difficulty up requiring player to by coin packs and power ups for near impossible puzzles with very little moves. They bleed players by pricing their power ups and coins for obscene amounts you need to level up or keep playing with moves run out. Will delete cause it isn't worth crazy costs for power ups/ continues.,NEGATIVE,1,0.989862919,21-Apr-24
Royal Match,In the beginning it's fun. Later the levels are designed to not be won without special items. You can see this when you lose when they ask you to spend 900 coins you are tempted each time with more moves until they give you more moves than we're given to complete the level to begin with.,POSITIVE,0,0.934064984,22-Apr-24
Royal Match,I love this game  every stage has different challenges  but some levels are extremely hard you can't get past them without using 900 coins which is also difficult to get  and no extra moves to complete some hard levels  other than that it's great and enjoyable.,POSITIVE,0,0.999182642,15-Apr-24
Royal Match,I am at level 2845  for those saying this is hard  yes it is  it tests your ability to focus so keep going I promise you'll make it. I have a severe TBI and this is the ONLY thing that I can focus on  which is weird. I ONLY buy when there's a special. I think they charge too much  I know developers need to make a living but seriously. NOTE TO DEVELOPERS: Please ADD the option to change our profile photo to one of our own from our phone file. Thanks,NEGATIVE,1,0.99437803,15-Apr-24
Royal Match,At first I did not like the game. Saw an ad and was different than the ad. Initially gave it a 1 star. Played some more bases off of other ratings and found some levels like the ad. THERE ARE NO ADS IN THIS GAME. I have yet to come across a single one. Hard to find a game like this these days. It's so nice and refreshing,POSITIVE,0,0.975896358,23-Apr-24
Royal Match,This game is really enjoyable; the graphics are great  and the challenges are attainable even in higher levels. I enjoy matching tile games in general  but this one is especially great b/c the player gets to build the king's castle rooms (as well as free him from disasters on occasion). I felt the joy of gaming like I haven't felt since my youth when the Nintendo (NES) came out  but the graphics & speed are SOOOO much better! :) This game is my favorite!,POSITIVE,0,0.999827385,18-Apr-24
Royal Match,As I expected  up to level 50 or so it is enjoyable enough. Then it becomes much too difficult to solve  thus kinda forcing you to buy (with your real money) various in-game gadgets to help you solve levels. So ... buy  and delete !,NEGATIVE,1,0.997594416,22-Apr-24
Royal Match,it is fun at first but since the developer control the game wiether they want you to pass the level or not it became stressful  you give 1hour free lives but it is very hard to pass 1 level  you really want us to purchase your coins  soooo disappointing..so b s !!! unstalled!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.998684466,28-Apr-24
Royal Match,Cool  another game that's not as advertised. Literally just a matching game. There's no getting the king out of ridiculous situations.... You just match blocks. The ads already looked slightly boring  and you managed to make it more boring than that. Congrats. DONT BOTHER,NEGATIVE,1,0.999297261,25-Apr-24
Royal Match,The reason I have brought down the rating is because  the super Bowl which a player gets after winning ten matches  is short lived. Immediately after the super Bowl is earned  the next level is hard or super hard with less moves. This demotivates me. I am even thinking of leaving this game now.. I am nearing 2300 level but I guess I'll leave it now.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997617543,24-Apr-24
Royal Match,**DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME** it is is set up to win and lose. There have been times that I had five in a row and did not get the super ball! Same with the TNT  helicopters and arrows. The squares and rows disappear but you don't get your items to help as it should. I am guessing that is built into the game program so you will lose and hopefully spend your money to buy more lives and things. The game is okay but I won't spend any money on it!,NEGATIVE,1,0.993512452,17-Feb-24
Royal Match,Unless you pay you will be stuck for days on some levels. No ads means no other option to get coins unless you pay. Total money grab.Why not give optional ads so coins or moves can be earned through watching ads ? You get paid either way. Hope you consider it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997691751,29-Apr-24
Royal Match,I've been playing this game a long time and really enjoy it! The best part is there are no ads! I like the extras (i.e.  building areas within the castle and grounds  as well as bonus challenges) that keep it interesting. It progresses in difficulty  which is also a plus! The team aspects are fun as well. I recommend it!,POSITIVE,0,0.999634147,23-Apr-24
Royal Match,Awesome game but horrible at the same time. 900 coins for 5 extra turns when you can't solve the puzzle. When you have no coins  they offer up to 35 turns  go figure. They want you to spend OBVIOUSLY.,POSITIVE,0,0.914265275,21-Apr-24
Royal Match,I used to like this game but I'm far along enough to where I can spend 20 bucks and within the hour I'd have to spend another 20 bucks just to be able to play it. Theyve made the game unplayable for me without spending 100s a day! Its greedy and I encourage everybody to not play this game. It's basically a scam. I'm sure royal match will respond with me having to write down my complaints and go threw a process to send it and do a bunch of work. How bout read my comment and fix the problem.,NEGATIVE,1,0.990569592,23-Apr-24
Royal Match,It's nothing like the ads  like most games  which I have learnt to ignore. I see people complaining about having to spend money  you don't  I'm up to the highest level yet and don't spend money in it  just save your boosters for when you need them ð it's not hard  just the right level of mind numbing activity to unwind with,NEGATIVE,1,0.953615665,15-Apr-24
Royal Match,Those who can not play the game are blaming it on the developers. You don't need to purchase any power-ups or such to complete levels. It is all up to your thinking capabilities. I'm in level 8301 ( the highest level so far)  and i didn't spend a single dime on this game. If you are not good with puzzles  don't blame it on the game. It's all on you! Also  everything i saw in the ads is in the game.,POSITIVE,0,0.988967121,20-Apr-24
Royal Match,The ads for the game is so misleading which is not good.. I downloaded the game because of the ads I saw just for me to open the game and see it's different. I haven't gotten to any level where I can save the king,NEGATIVE,1,0.999463022,24-Apr-24
Royal Match,It's fun for a while until you get sp far. Then the fun quickly dissipates as you don't seem to have much of a chance on every level and get fewer points if you do manage to clear a level unless you want to spend money. I'd liken it to a rigged carnival game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997246146,28-Apr-24
Royal Match,All the complaints are not necessary  is just a game and a matter of choice. For me i enjoy the game very well it gets me glued to my screen when am bored and am at level 8101 without transactions just like someone said though i tried to do it. But your team need to improve on the light balls is not fair that after any failed level  it will reset. keep improving for people like me,POSITIVE,0,0.994976938,29-Apr-24
Royal Match,I think this game is pretty fun. The only thing about it that made me make it a 4 star was that you can get really bored and you only do 1 thing  do the matching. I get that's what the game is about  though. One thing  though  you can only really use your coins if you're out of moves. You get 1 000 000 of them! Other than that  I enjoyed it. ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.658690214,28-Apr-24
Royal Match,Good game no ads as mentioned  however animation is alittle slow and can you please add in the option for me to clear the area one shot without having to press every single task? I have a thousand plus stars but i dont want to sit through all the pressing and animation,NEGATIVE,1,0.997185051,15-Apr-24
Royal Match,Installed for 5 points. Seen ads several times. Game nothing like advertised. Just a candy crush clone but at least the levels I played weren't drowning in ads. However  it isn't really a  game  since if you hesitate for even a second  it will just tell you the best move to make  eliminating the already non-existent challenge. If you like Candy Crush  you might like this game. Personally  I'm annoyed by the fake advertising.,NEGATIVE,1,0.977633178,30-Mar-24
Royal Match,It's not necessarily pay to win  but there is a lot of pay to advance - because  you'll get tired of playing the same level 35 times. As someone who's gone through the games levels  and no has to play something like a  tournament  or whatever  it can get super expensive if you aren't super patient.,NEGATIVE,1,0.990729511,21-Apr-24
Royal Match,I dont know why all the complaints about difficulty. Microtransactions are immoral  so I have never spent a cent(and dont intend to)on this game and am at level 8201. Yes  some levels are more difficult than others but if you get super lightball after beating 10 levels and play smart you can sail though 100 levels or more in no time. The Save King ads are misleading  it happens every 50 levels. And theres a coin gathering level every 100 levels. Im in a good team who help with lives and events.,NEGATIVE,1,0.968503058,15-Apr-24
Royal Match,Sweetend Milk  they've changed the algorithm. You aren't imagining it. You have to   Pay To Play   in the upper levels. It was a fun game early on  but  it's the same company as ToonBlast. If you're really stuck  spend 5-10 $ ( USD ) and you won't get stuck on 50-100 attempts at a level for a couple days. Unfortunately  you will need to spend the same amount every couple days.,NEGATIVE,1,0.993669808,17-Apr-24
Royal Match,This game is fun but once you get through so much of it it begins to not give you any way to win except use everything you got hoping you'll spend a little money. Is it a fun game  yes sir it is but you're still in that wealth trap where they try to get your money you'll end up staying on a stage all day long and it won't give you any moves to help you get close enough to win. And before I get feedback I'm playing four phones at one time and they're all different games at the same stages,NEGATIVE,1,0.995038927,18-Apr-24
Royal Match,FALSE ADVERTISING!! This app was one of the very annoying ads I had to watch while playing other games. The ads promoted a game of solving puzzles to save a king  but that's less than 1% of the game. i didnt know the public could be so blatantly lied to. Have i just been lucky all my life that most things have worked as expected? I guess I can return or not use what doesn't work  so I would suggest you pass on this app if you're looking for the game it is advertised to be.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999450624,21-Feb-24
Royal Match,I'm sad. At first I loved this game so much. No ads  lots of power ups  lots of fun events. Then  at higher levels  it becomes ridiculously hard. Yes these types of games are always challenging at some point  but like other people have said  it's just absurd. The difficulty doesn't change progressively  it does so all of a sudden  and I'm not enjoying it anymore because of how many days it takes to solve one level  and events requiring you to pass on your first try everytime... It's ridiculous.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997311831,18-Mar-24
Royal Match,Full rating for this game. This game has no annoying ads and what makes me amazed is the customer support. They are so helpful and friendly.

Royal Match,It's not a bad game but after watching the advert and downloading it you got to find out that it is not close to what was played in the advert  you can't see a snake pursuing the king or water or fire  it's just the game you play(candy) I think people should now about this before downloading the game and not giving them a different view about this game until they download it just because you want them to download your game  it's is not fair at all.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997738957,26-Apr-24
Royal Match,Space Mission is flawed. In between rounds  you have to wait for propellers to be added to count  then lava mission to show how many players were eliminated. After  cards to be unlocked/revealed. So much time is wasted between rounds by pointless animations. Space mission I and II are fine  but since III is first to 7  it's difficult to overcome such nonsense getting in the way. Stop having so much nonsense at the home screen and let the players actually play.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999738395,31-Mar-24
Royal Match,After you get so many levels  it's gets to a point where you either have to play a level 10 times to beat it or purchase items to help. So I'm now deleting it. I'll find a new game to waste time.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999780715,18-Apr-24
Royal Match,Been playing this game for a long time and will keep playing  BUT  it gets HARD. You can be stuck on one level for DAY or longer.... There are no ads to watch for coins and you either have to pay or hope your team gets a prize  or just keep trying over and over again. (Just to get stuck on the next level),NEGATIVE,1,0.998981655,15-Apr-24
Royal Match,Standard match game. No obnoxious ads  good time waster. Edit: it eventually got too hard to be fun without paying money  Also the ad for the game is misleading because the levels where you save the king are very rare  it's usually just puzzle levels. I leave the 5 stars because it does not have ads  and it did take about a year to get too hard.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997890532,2-Apr-24
Royal Match,Played the game for a couple of days. It was fun  but noticed the game seems to have an algorithm where it doesn't make it fair at all to progress without making purchases. Monopoly Go does this too. I played about 22 games on this one level and couldn't get passed it and after every time the purchase options kept shuffling faster trying to entice me to extend the game by a few more turns.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996759951,5-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,This is the best football game ever. The reason i gave 2 stars is because I'm facing some head to head issues. Whenever i click 'play' in head to head the screen goes black while the commentry is going is going on. Then I have to restart the game to play again. The game is sometimes stuck in the middle of a match.it shows that there is no internet. The game should have an option to transfer ranks and training without loosing that player in other words training transfer!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.992803276,28-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,I absolutely love this game! ð However  I have a suggestion for the producers: allowing coins  gems  and FC points to be transferred between friends would take the game to the next level. This feature would foster a sense of community and love ð among players  and from a practical standpoint  would be incredibly advantageous. No more panicking when you need a crucial upgrade - just ask your friends for help! I hope the developers consider my feedback. Thanks!,POSITIVE,0,0.998977423,30-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,Pretty solid but a recommendation; we should be able to change the player who takes a freekick behind the half court. This is very frustrating cos mostly it's our defenders who take the kick when it's so backed out and their shot is nowhere near the target when we actually have a chance to hit a direct screamer if it was our attacking midfielder or attacker. Thanks for reading this much cos womp womp,NEGATIVE,1,0.993040442,28-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,I love this game a lot but there are some issues I have with the game. For example it's to easy to score and it doesn't show replays of when a player attempt to score and miss. Another complaint is that the players don't react quickly  when the match starts players just stay in one spot instead of pressing the opponent and also it's to easy to dribble a player.,NEGATIVE,1,0.797856629,22-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,Why is jockeying removed? Defending has become impossible. If u do a sudden turn with the defender  they pause for 3 seconds which gives the attacker space to run. Defending was fine as it was before the update. You all fix one aspect of the game and then ruin other. You know what the opponent is going to do and you move your joystick along with the attacker  but one sudden turn and they have all the space in the world the have a shot. Fix your game E.A.,NEGATIVE,1,0.950731575,19-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,It has potential. Lags constantly  takes 10mins to load  gives you the most random free players at the start. Good players are too hard to get  and too hard to rank up. Prices are way too high. The old Fifa Mobile was WAY. Also winning h2hs are impossible. Its rigged. Megging is impossible. Free kicks are soooooo easy to score! Playing matches takes too long  and good packs are unpayable. If you finish the star pass  it's worth buying but otherwise it's just a scam.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999036431,21-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,An amazing game it is  I'll be honest. But something in the game disgusts me. Whenever I pass the ball to my teamate  in Advanced Passing  it ends up passing it to the opponent  and they counter. Another thing is that my goals decreased in VS Attack and my opponent's increased. Also  the game often shows Great and Good Chances but  during the game it gives much less Great and Good chances and increases the Okay chances. Please fix this.,NEGATIVE,1,0.866811931,20-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,Reinstalled after a year  game still just keeps loading and lagging. The interface is new. Honestly  the servers are so bad that the game at times needs to be forced closed because the screen won't respond at all. The progression and everything seems better  but seriously  the loading and lagging of the game is really annoying. Screen keeps getting grey  and I can't proceed anywhere in the game after entering a match/skill game  everything freezes.

EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,Its an awesome football game  funny part is  I physically sucks at playing in real life  but on here I'm really good cause I'm drawn by it's graphics and commentaries and the overall build up. But lately the game keeps crashing with an error message saying RESOURCE DOWNLOAD ERROR stating that I should connect to the network or free up my storage even theough I have a space that can operate fc mobile twice if it was possible and this issue has kept me out of the game for weeks now  its not nice,NEGATIVE,1,0.999094725,29-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,The game's performance has deteriorated since the April update  and I suspect there's an issue with the server. Despite having a stable internet connection (3G  4G  or 5G)  the server responds with a red ping  causing lag and making it challenging to play Head-to-Head (H2H) matches. Furthermore  the player who sends the game request has a slight advantage over the one who accepts it. EA Sports need to resolve this issue promptly and optimize their server.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999460995,27-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,don't get me wrong it's an interesting game  hustling to create your own ultimate team. You can get any past or present player your head can think of which is so much fun. But I Had to reduce it to 2 stars. After the so called gameplay update I rarely win matches  everything is messed up including DEFENCE. Lastly chances of getting good players from packs after spending a lot should be increasedð  Nevertheless  I'll still recommend. You won't find a more elaborate football game like this one.,POSITIVE,0,0.924417615,23-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,While playing a few matches I noticed that the ref gives unfair advantage to the opponent even when a player doesn't do anything it just blows a whistle for unfair advantage which is annoying because it happens alot and also usually when the whistle is about to be blown for half time or full time and I am about to score a goal they don't allow to score the goal but instead just blow the whistle which is also annoying and makes us to lose points which is really bad,NEGATIVE,1,0.999715865,28-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,I am willing to look past the pay to win aspect of this game  because you can still get decent players for free through events. But what annoys me the most is that when the opponent disconnects in a head to head match  the game still continues with an AI  which is impossible to beat. I request the devs to make it so that the match ends if the opponent disconnects. It is very frustrating when you are winning and the opponents disconnects  and you get beat by an overpowering AI.,NEGATIVE,1,0.992640913,15-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,Terrible update! I have been really enjoying the game for years but I don't know what you've done in the last update (9.4.24) but it's destroyed the game. Players now feel like they are running through mud  passing is so slow  randomly switching players mid chasing down an opponent  shooting instead of playing a through ball and as for the shooting  it's painful  you have to press shoot about 3 seconds before you actually want to shoot. Nearly every match now ends 0-0. You've ruined the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999777138,9-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,This is indeed an awesome game  but still lags behind efootball due to: 1. Inability to view opponent line -ups. 2. Inability to pause the match and substitute. 3. Inability to see game and player stats during and after the game. 4. Lack of at least 3 different replay angles. 5. Lack of free pvp matches. Here we need to pay  at times in cash. 6. Inaccuracies in aiming when completing in-game tasks that involve shooting  free kicks and penalties.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998582721,16-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,The app overall is great. The new update has made it even better but I really want some things to say. Sometimes in tight matches this happens quite often  I was about to score a goal but suddenly it was full time  just give a little extra time.... these 2-3 injury time goes like a flash.... like in few seconds the time is over!!! Its irritating sometimes! When the goal is guaranteed!! Second of all please add training transfer which was there in the prev version of game.... it a game changer!,NEGATIVE,1,0.960397601,9-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,This game is a really cool game but it can get very annoying sometimes  the probability of winning a good player in an exchange or a purchase at the store is very low making it very annoying. Getting coins and diamonds too is very difficult and the gameplay can really be annoying sometimes especially in manager mode where players shoot from all angles leading to a goal and goalkeepers are less likely to save a shot and every player can be whack sometimes. Do something especially manager mode.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998147607,18-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,There is a very annoying glitch that doesn't let me enter matches like I can enter the match but it just freezes either during the kickoff or the on the loading screen.

EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,So far this is one of my best football games I love it a lot but though it still need some fixes like members of a particular league should be able to transfer particular cards coins and gems between each other and if someone is playing with a friend and a draw occurs there should be extra time and penalty shootout. If those particular things can be fixed it would be a perfect game,POSITIVE,0,0.972639918,9-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,Players are too costly. Network are sometimes bad. Activation of handball should be allowed.Also it's always cracking sometimes even when there is data connection.

EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,The game is very laggy. Head to head don't even work  and I'm just next to my wifi router. In vs atack it gives you the higher winning rate  and then you lose. A lot of players that have a high overall is bad like GK Martinez  he has good stats but can't even stop a normal ball. I didn't get even a greate chance in vs atack while I had the better chance  and there is just random fouls when I did nothing  or the game committed the foul and then they get penalty,NEGATIVE,1,0.999007642,19-Apr-24

Sometimes its laggy even when opening up rewards  navigating between events/menu. Tried with different wifi/4G  am sure it's not caused by my internet.

EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,I'll always commend the efforts of the team responsible for graphics design and content. It's top notch to be honest. It's glad to find out that the new update has finally done justice to the bugs and server issue. I had a smooth gameplay today unlike previous times. Going through the game  I discovered there was no option for training transfer which I think should be the utmost concern in this update.

EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,When the system autoplays for a player you cannot get past their players with neither pace nor a skill move. They just tag along. Autoplay should play the same as other AI matches. No wonder people just leave the system to autoplay when they are defending. Unless you think of some ingenious way  you aren't getting past any player on autoplay. Remaining bugs: the camera angle still not changing after a freekick remains and the decelaration curve has not improved much.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999627471,28-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,There are countless bugs in the game. Sometimes the match loading screen is black and when the game starts  the controls disappear and I just watch my players lose the ball.Sometimes I finish the game and wait for half an hour for the result screen to load. Players with an average of 93 cannot pass. They throw the ball to ridiculous places and cannot catch the passes. I would understand if player was a low overall player  but 92 overall Lewandowski makes that mistakes?,NEGATIVE,1,0.999758065,17-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,This is probably the worst version of the fc mobile game and you guys should bring back the effective crossing and heading otherwise reduce the ability of the goalkeeper because they behave as if they have super powers. Also increase the pace of the players and maintain the culture of the game rather than making it look like something else. Other games like e football are always improving while you are reducing the ability of the players  who does that? It's now more difficult to score a goal .,NEGATIVE,1,0.999624729,15-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,Game  not better than the previous version. Is there no tester/QA in this company? The virtual stick often freezes and refuses to move. Game freezes  and especially when you are attacking or defending  ending up missing the chance of scoring or conceding  respectively. Crossing is worse compared to the previous version before the update. It is no longer pinpoint. A right-footed player can no longer give an accurate crossing with his left foot and vice versa. This version made the game worse.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999763429,10-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,The Game is good but pls add a feature of leagues like if anyone wants to play fifa World Cup they can easily play it in tournaments and pls add chat option and make any links of the account so that if the player wants to play with their friends (in their locals) can easily add them.

EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,EA has ruined the beautiful game of FCð­the recent game before the update was perfect  and I loved it  but now it has completely changed... e.g  it was more effective to defend automatically without directing the player  but now the defenders are less good  and also the goalkeepers don't do anything because anytime you shoot  it's a goal... please fix my favorite game!! and it was really cool to transfer training to another player before you sell them  and now it's no longer there!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.996490777,13-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,Hello. I am still enjoying the game. It's the only game I play on my phone. I have positive feelings about them we gameplay update. The passing is way better. As well as dribbling. And crossing is not as overpowered as before however I feel Ike defending is worse. It's either the new attacking features makes defending harder or something is off. Especially when you move defenders forward to press an attacking player. They move fast. Leaving open space and a opposing player can easily pass them,NEGATIVE,1,0.958813965,14-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,Don't know if writing a review is even necessary cause nothing seems to change but here goes....Stop!

EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,It used to work very well but now the player just keep passing the ball wherever. The ball can get passed to the opponent out of the blue.

EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,Like the game  looks realistic and fun to play. But my issue is that online matches are too fast and the duration of each game is not enough for me(others may disagree) One more thing  can you please add futsal in game as I really enjoy watching it on YouTube and would love to play it on mobile as I do not have a pS5 or an X-box After all of that  I would say it is a pretty good game.

EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,I never wanted to write a review but you've forced my too. The crossing in this new game update is rubbish  it doesn't go where you direct it. Secondly  when you search for your friends it doesn't show everyone with that same name  it's really frustrating when you want to play against your friend and you both can't find each other one the game.

EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,Main problem is trying to do the challenge mode matches which are against AI for prizes. These games are genuinely scripted for you to lose  I dont even have a bad team  I have a really good team at 98 OVR against a DUMBER AI team of 100 OVR. I have actually seen my players deliberately move OUT OF THE WAY of the AI attackers even though I am sending commands to do the opposite  the game WANTS you to lose.

EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,The worlds worst football game ever. Even if you maxed out the goalkeeper they still play dumb and the ai in this game is very dumb they try to pass it to the enemy and it said  improved ai smart  but they just got dumber. The offside is just useless since the player didnt even touch it and it got a offside. Some player's has another but when i try to upgrade it says no available players. A waste of money and a waste of wasting time that a simple problem can't be fixed what a scam.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999820888,19-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,Have been playing this game for three months  now I can finally give my impression. First off all  too many 'scripted' games especially in Manager Mode. And then in H2H  opponents often purposely disconnected to let AI play for them after scoring or getting behind in score. There must be something as a punishment. Lastly  the new update which nerf the cross spammers  bring us a terrible state of defenders which oftentimes losing their position. Hope those problems will be fixed soon.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998661518,19-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,the gameplay is very good 1)the referee is absolutely worst. how we carry the ball and touch the opponent  but the foul is for the opponent 2)extra time is useless. when i want to counterattack to get a score  the referee blows the whistle 3)the players didn't react when they're given a pass when close to the opponent 4)i want a long pass but the ball goes to the nearest player 5)when chasing the ball and passing to the nearest player  instead of passing it changes to the other player WhatAGame,NEGATIVE,1,0.997788429,18-Apr-24
EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,The new update made the game absolutely unplayable. The game is now full of bugs. The players keep passing the ball back  this has happened one too many times. I'm not joking when I say this  on average  it happens 3 to 4 times a game. One game  my opponent goal keeper rushed and my player dribbled past him  leaving the goal open  I shot  even the bar appeared  but my player passed the ball back.

There is no equality to the tries given between players... If it were tries  then they would add up equal at the end. If it was time  then it would end for both players at the same time.

EA SPORTS FCâ¢ Mobile Soccer,Arguably the best football game for mobile though there are some apparent issues It might just be nostalgia but the old rank up system of last year was much better than the cards you have to use now. Not only was it easier to access  but paired with training transfer (please bring this back) wouldn't have you searching for any special cards to upgrade your 97 rated when you have a level 20 92 rated card.

They make one to even lose the will to continue. I mean  who would want to continue spend their data on tutorials huh? Just make an option to skip those tutorials and get down with the real thing.

Clash of Clans,Good game  but at certain point building and upgrading takes such a long time that the gameplay becomes quite dull. Developers need to earn  of course  but the gameplay progress can be better managed to be more friendly. Additionally  reduce the cost needed for walls and time for hero upgrades. It's fine if the heroes can't be used  but taking more than three days makes them somehow useless; the same for walls - many troops can just ignore these days.

But there are some problem which spoils the game. 1) We get very less resources from battles in builder base. 2) Heroes take lot of time to upgrade. If you want to max them you can never use them. So if they allow to use heroes while upgrading it will be nice. 3) Very high cost of upgrading walls in both the bases.,NEGATIVE,1,0.980538607,1-Apr-24
Clash of Clans,I have poor wifi connections sometimes and whenever that happens  I don't close the game but there's the  weak connection  pop-up  and if I were to restart the wifi  my internet does get fixed but before I lose my connection I already had deployed troops. Because of that one second of me turning my wifi off and on  my trophies get reduced  even if I had the time left  approximately 2 mins and 30 seconds. There should be an option to continue instead of finishing the game when there's time left.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999642134,16-Apr-24
Clash of Clans,The game play is great. However  on Samsung Galaxy A13  after the last couple of updates  the game start-up time (from initiating the app to showing the Supercell logo) has extended from a few seconds to 1 minute 42 seconds. The delay also applies when switching between game accounts. Please reduce the start-up time back to a few seconds. The Feb 2024 update fixed the slow start issue. Thank you.,POSITIVE,0,0.64552182,3-Mar-24
Clash of Clans,First of all  absolutely beautiful game  but two stars are gone because of what I feel are the two major issues. 1. The heroes take too much time to upgrade  if you want to max them out  you never even use them in battle. I believe this issue can be easily fixed by allowing the heroes to go into battle while upgrading 2. In the builder base  it takes ages just to collect enough to upgrade a building. The wall upgrades are outrageous  one wall costs more gold than what you get from a 6star attack,NEGATIVE,1,0.995487511,3-Mar-24
Clash of Clans,Honestly  I absolutely love this game. It's a great way to pass the time. The competitive aspect of the game is amazing. The graphics are simplistic  nicely detailed and swift  also making the game accessible to many devices. I've been in and out of it and every time I come back  it's I worth it. The reason I'm not giving a five star rating is the long upgrades  there's too much delay which kind of takes away the fast pacedness of a strategic moba rpg.,POSITIVE,0,0.999639988,16-Apr-24
Clash of Clans,It's a great game. I have been playing for several years now. I really have no complaints about it except getting kicked off from time to time and it seems to happen when either your doing a raid or in the middle of a war or attack and outta nowhere you just lose connection. Now with excellent wifi as one connection and 5G as another connection one would think there is no way possible getting kicked off . But I was told updating the game stops this so I did that and it just kicked me again.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99260062,13-Apr-24
Clash of Clans,It's a really good game. I've been playing for 4 years on my current and a year or two on my 9  and it's a good game to commit to spend time on. But there is some problems with the available lity of certain magic items. And my old review was a 5 star but I had to change because the event's they keep doing are good for sure but there's always a event pass for 5.99$ that has decorations you can't get if you don't spend the money.,NEGATIVE,1,0.723131776,11-Apr-24
Clash of Clans,I've been playing this game for a while and everything has been going well. There's nothing wrong about it until this point. I am having trouble opening the game lately because of  lag issues  meanwhile my wifi is perfectly fine. I have to open it close it and open it again multiple times for it to actually open without lagging. I hope this bug gets fixed soon.,POSITIVE,0,0.99756372,17-Apr-24
Clash of Clans,It describes the real definition of a fun game. But that's true until townhall 9 arrives. After TH 9   it's a game of patience  leadership   tactics and all those things that cover mind skills . It improves your observation skills . But do remember one thing   a game is healthy for you until you let it to be a game   but once you lose control   addiction will win ð. Quite interesting ð¤ right? Play for once   you'll find it by yourself .,POSITIVE,0,0.997465849,28-Apr-24
Clash of Clans,A fun  well designed game that's NOT pay to play + NO ADS. Entertaining things to do both with + without a clan. Game is always evolving + improving. You can be on your own if you want  but I'd suggest joining a clan to get the most out of the game. I love all the incredible detail + effort put into every little thing. A lot of hard work and care went into this creation and its maintenance  which is probably why the game has been successful so long. It's truly a great game.,POSITIVE,0,0.999774039,17-Apr-24
Clash of Clans,Great experience while playing the game but it have some major flaws. First of all  the hero upgrades. The heroes are useless in actual game because if we want to max them  we'll never be able to upgrade them. There should be a quality of life update where we can use heroes in battle while upgrading. Second  the builder base upgrade costs are outrageous and the elixir rewarded is very low after the battle. Third  the wall costs are just crazy. These things must be fixed  specially the Heroes.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999526978,17-Apr-24
Clash of Clans,TLDR: 9/10! Long: I've been playing off and on for roughly 10 years now and I have to say  the recent updates have made all the systems more refined and you can tell the developers actually care about long term playability. The events are consistent and gems can be farmed relatively quickly. Free to play  but pay to go faster is a good balance in my opinion  especially with how many pkgs they offer for different budgets. It's challenging  but fun. Takes less than 30 min/day usually. I love it!,POSITIVE,0,0.999687076,26-Mar-24
Clash of Clans,I hope the next update does not focus on the next townhall level just yet there is still more this to upgrade specially the hero equipments. We need a new game mode which give a few more of the ores apart from how we normally get them. I may introduce a type of currency that give an option to buy the ores and other things that the new game may offer. If I were to spend more time in this game it should be for something that makes me feel im progressing,NEGATIVE,1,0.994212449,26-Apr-24
Clash of Clans,Lately I have been facing a bug/glitch.I can not use seige machines in battle even though I have it in my CC. Before going for a raid I can see seige machines in my army but in battles there is no seige machines on the deployment bar. This is happening almost everytime. Sometimes I remove it and reinforce myself again which sometimes work but most of the time it doesn't. I'd like to request clash team to fix this because this is sometime frustrating. THANK YOU,NEGATIVE,1,0.995719373,20-Apr-24
Clash of Clans,I've been a long standing player of clash  the game is brilliant  it has taught me a lot about strategies etc.. my biggest gripe is the game has gotten very expensive  I've always purchased the gold pass since day 1 and at 4.99 it was a fair price but now it's 6.99 it getting out of reach especially now SC keep adding in the extra 4.99 challenges  I fully appreciate you don't have to purchase it but if you want the special abilities on offer  well.... ð¢,POSITIVE,0,0.929340363,11-Mar-24
Clash of Clans,Coc is still going strong after so many years. If you're looking for a quick  fastpaced game this isnt for you. Game basically relies on slow and gradual progress overtime to level up and eventually max out your base. Attacking bases can be strategic  enhancing player experience which I personally love so much and defending your base comes all on predictions on your opponents move which could get challenging. Other than that  NO FORCED ADS!! Coc wins money on esports and inapp pirchaers no ads!!,POSITIVE,0,0.706637144,10-Mar-24
Clash of Clans,It's kinda getting better every month especially with all the community events recently. But my main complaint would be the fact they should make it easier to get ores without forcing us to play special events because a special event every two months is repetitive and not a good thing. Also it would be great if the game had two trophy systems instead of just one  like how clash royale has path of legends without risk of you losing any trophies in your main trophy road.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998621225,22-Mar-24
Clash of Clans,This game is indeed Excellent  but one thing I want to point out is the graphics  I think it should be better if the team were to put an option to adjust the density of pixels. Also it would be better if the troops' movement will be animated closely to reality. Because  since I played this game I never really noticed the difference over time in terms of the graphics and animation. Thank you  hopping for a feedback.,POSITIVE,0,0.954184055,24-Mar-24
Clash of Clans,I have been playing this game for more than 8 years and I love playing this game in my alone time and free time. Although I had to restart several times due to the first phone change not saving my progress but I started over down pat I'm piggybacking with game drops and more disconnects from the server. Other than that I have no complaints.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998994291,19-Apr-24
Clash of Clans,I like Clash of Clans to a large degree. Great gameplay  building of characters & buildings  however there are some glitches in the game I'm not happy about at all. I recently combined multi archer towers  and it does not show up when I get attacked  which is ruining my defense on the game. Not happy about this at all  and yes I already contacted support with screen shots.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996352077,24-Mar-24
Clash of Clans,So the addition of the ore system is pretty cool BUT the amount supercell gives us should be criminal. Like what am I supposed to do with 70 glowy ore and 10 starry ore per CW win? 1 upgrade costs 600!!!!! I'd literally have to save for 3 months just to upgrade ONE ability to level 14. Get it together supercell. Y'all need to either start having events or raise the amount that we can win. Because the current system just isn't cutting it. Otherwise ...love the game,NEGATIVE,1,0.900865972,17-Apr-24
Clash of Clans,this game is literally my childhood  such a great game but very time consuming to max out townhalls and upgrade time takes forever. Also I like the new events coming in where you can get skins or equipments for heros by grinding the game only  but what I don't like about is the trophy gain it may be easy sometimes but when you have a 2 star and 99% and lose time you gain trophy on the amount of stars you have not based on your damage which is stupid sometimes but reasonable  still a great game.,POSITIVE,0,0.9863469,27-Feb-24
Clash of Clans,It's a fantastic phone game  the fact that it's still going strong after almost 12 YEARS  is a great indication of having found a good balance between monetisation perks and F2P gameplay. Hero equipment has been a great recent addition  though the rate it's currently being released combined with ore acquisition and the FOMO of potentially having to spend gems to access future equipment if you miss an event  makes it really exhausting and grind-heavy at times. Do play  do take breaks. Have fun!,POSITIVE,0,0.707989275,2-Apr-24
Clash of Clans,The game is excellent!!  but sometimes the matchmaking is so unfair  if someone attack my base there's allot of loots and trophy's taken i/on my base  mostly in trophy I've been experience it  but when I'm the attacker the loots and trophy is not enough/few (it's always happening) don't be unfair!  please fix it same o/in clan war  it's always missed match  it's okay but it's too much.

Clash of Clans,Very fun game the only reason I give it 4 stars is because eventually you hit a time wall and you either pay money or wait a ridiculous time to complete upgrade. When you have only 2 builders and it takes 8 hrs+ to upgrade something you log on for 2 seconds pick something and log out. There isn't much to do in-between that time,NEGATIVE,1,0.989652097,23-Apr-24
Clash of Clans,Great game. Though I'd like to note that I have the gold pass this season and have been upgrading my volcanic mortar defense on the BB and it shows before upgrading a shorter time than after starting the upgrade. Ex. It says 2d 9 hrs to go from lvl 2 to 3 then I start the upgrade and it jumps to over 3 days. It did the same from lvl 1 to 2,NEGATIVE,1,0.906824887,22-Apr-24
Clash of Clans,For me it's the best strategy game   i have been playing this game for almost 4 to 5 years and i really like it but still there is something in the game that i hope the developer will change it 1. Attack enemy base with hero while still they are upgrading 2. Same level of Focus on royal champion skin just like other heros skin 3. Able to provide more ores for those who can't afford to buy season pass That's it   i Don't have other problem like how expensive to upgrade or their upgradable timer,POSITIVE,0,0.995046854,10-Apr-24
Clash of Clans,Ive played this game for about 9 years. Supercell has added alot of things over the years.. however it seems lately there challenges have become oddly extremely hard to complete. The town halls are nearly impossible to take down unless your some YouTube pro. They have really been working hard to suck the fun out of the game and money from your pocket! No you don't have to spend money. but! Good luck getting ahead if not! After 9 years  I'm Close to deleting altogether!,NEGATIVE,1,0.997250974,21-Apr-24
Clash of Clans,This is a good strategy game and not very addictive since the upgrades takes too much time and so does the army . However there are many room for improvement . The way we can use troops in the battle while they are upgrading in laboratory the same should be done for heroes since getting 3 stars without heroes is almost impossible at higher townhalls. Also they should really reduce the cost of upgrading walls . Rest everything is perfect,POSITIVE,0,0.58233285,4-Mar-24
Clash of Clans,The game is really good. But the upgrade timing is too much and if I want to fight multiplayer battle. I would only get like 7-20 trophies for winning and 35-40 trophies for loosing. There is also a bug due to which sometime COC can't be opened it's like it is stuck at the same place while loading and this happens 7-8 time within few hours and then it will open. After a few hours it will again stop opening and another few hours later it will open. I am seriously tired of this.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998290002,19-Mar-24
Clash of Clans,I have just turned 23 years old  and have had this game on every phone since 6th grade.

Clash of Clans,This game is absolutely fantastic and very relaxing . But somethings need to be resolved . 1. When the heroes are unlocked they are provided at high level but after the deadline it becomes very difficult to use them . 2. I am currently at town hall 9 and whenever I try to attack then players of town hall 10 or above come up which is very bad and also the trophies for winning is very low when somebody of the same level comes up .

Clash of Clans,It's a good game. I just don't understand why some or your game decorations only hang around for a few days then disappear forever and give nobody a clue where to get it. & by the time I find out it's gone. And never seen a game go through so many updates in a month than any other game ever. Filling our memory chip to the max. That's why I don't give 5 stars.

Clash of Clans,The game is amazing and a great time killer  I love it and play it all the time. My only issue with the game is the gold pass. It's way too short  and the timer is too long. It would be good if you could extend the gold pass with more levels or make the timer less than it already is  I find my self waiting for 10-15 days for it to end and it gets a little bit boring ð´,NEGATIVE,1,0.997695863,5-Mar-24
Clash of Clans,Been playing on and off for about 10 years. But i have a problem. My account was extremely rushed  and ive been upgrading for about half a year now  and im not even halfway done. This isnt becaus of a lack of ressources  its because of upgrade time. Yes its part of the game  but i think that a 7 day upgrade time is just too long  especially when you have limited amounts of builders. I am currently th12  and my normal upgrade take about 2-5 days  which is really just too long.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999579608,3-Mar-24
Clash of Clans,This game is really fun to play here and there and even tho the progress gets slower at the higher town hall levels it is still very fun and with all the new updates there is always something to do to keep you engaged while everything else upgrades. The only negative is that heroes are not deployable when they are upgrading which is painful because they take forever the more you progress in the game and it is difficult to plan a startegy when you are unabls to use them. Overall its a fun game,POSITIVE,0,0.996813238,17-Mar-24
Clash of Clans,Played the game for some time. Not thrilled with how long it takes to upgrade anything to a decent level or the cost of resources for upgrades. Quickly killed the desire to continue on for me. Also  there's a glitch with the game where the actual upgrade time is longer than what it initially says it will be. Regardless of the glitch  upgrade timeframes are still unreasonably long.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999424815,21-Apr-24
Clash of Clans,Best game to dominate and defend bases! Honestly  this game has a ton of ways to do so  going from your basic barbarians to dragons and the mythic troops! Now  yes  it does take a lot of time to make such small progress  but my  lot of time  (2-3 days) got me up to town hall 5 already with almost 3 builders and I would never dislike the game unless they got rid of something with a ton of potential. I'd reccomend downloading 100% if you want to include yourself in wars  clans  and defense!,POSITIVE,0,0.989042342,31-Mar-24
Clash of Clans,As a leader of my clan for the last 10 years it surprising to me that so little has been done to help manage a clan. The only real change in the last 10 years is now the ability to see when someone last opened the game. There needs to be a system that shows war participation of precious war when queuing a new war. There also needs to be a demerit system to help track repeat offenders who frequently miss attacks. Simply being able to add up to 3 red dots next to someone's name would suffice.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995883405,22-Mar-24

Clash of Clans,This game is really good  I only gave 3 stars because of this one huge problem: Ores. Upgrading heroes back then used to upgrade their ability... Now we upgrade those same abilities with ores. Ores are so damn hard to obtain. Also  if you do this  please decrease hero upgrade cost and time. Make the Book of Heroes less expensive and more accessible.

Clash of Clans,This game. Got worst over the updates  firstly they removed the need for elixir for training  this might see a good thing on surface but this reduces the needs of resources. Secondly there is some sort of shield system  a shield for 14 hrs after a successful attack on your base. (10-20% of your resources are looted during a attack  including not needing resources to train army.) this outputs many ppl to just forget about defense  others to loot since they'll just earn more in the shield time.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998317957,26-Apr-24

I suggest you not to download this game because you will only get disappointment  irritation and frustration out of it. So I did what you guys told me to do i.e. to contact your support team.

Also their replies did not help me at all Your support team is not supportive at all. They are there only to help you cheat the players by extracting the hard earned money of the players.

WWE Champions,I love the game but it gets boring knowing that if you have money to put on this game you quickly realize that whales always win and us that are limited on funds get blown away in all the contests. Game has gotten better but still has a long way for the contests to be even which still leaves allot of game to be played.

WWE Champions,I have played a good amount of time  and I am a big WWE fan. I could play this game for hours if I could and wish and possibly could try. This game is good. There is also a funny glitch in the game  and I hope it stays. Ricochet gets his opponents down to Danger  and for some reason  my opponents would randomly do the 630 Splash on me/Ricochet  and I pin them and win.

WWE Champions,Used to like this game until it became a pay to win type of game. The CPU characters are overpowered  therefore making nearly impossible to win unless you pay a fortunate to attempt to either  receive  or upgrade your characters. Needless to say  I have deleted this ridiculously money hungry game. If I could leave less than a one star rating  I would.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999705493,25-Mar-24
WWE Champions,Game continuously freezes then you loose the match when you have to reset. The store is expensive as hell. Even spending on this game you still lose to characters half your strength. I'm frustrated with it and about to delete it. At least won't ever spend another dime on it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999668121,14-Feb-24
WWE Champions,Tried linking my account to Scopely and instead of linking the 2 accounts  it created a brand new 2nd account and locked me out my original (was league level 9). Customer support is trash because since they could see that 3 accounts were tied to my email (yes  I tried again and a 3rd account was generated). Since they don't utilize a password system  nor can you link your account with Google play  they force you to know every detail with the account in question (ie. Faction  coins  cash  etc.),NEGATIVE,1,0.999623537,16-Feb-24
WWE Champions,Don't waste your time downloading. Only way to stay competitive is to spend thousands. They have screwed up many times because of their coders then take inventory from you. They tell you something is at one price then take it away from you and give you way less of a bargain. Feuding which used to be fun is now just pay walled and has too many rare characters. All events require extremely rare characters which again are locked behind hundreds of dollars. Imo don't waste your time or money.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996812046,13-Mar-24
WWE Champions,Ive been playing this game for years. The only thing i dont like is when you get keys 9times out of 10 you get 3 star silver and mostly same wrestlers of no value to you  so why tap. You may have reviewed it but it doesnt act random. I feel it choses for you. Stops when it wants not when you tap it to finish,NEGATIVE,1,0.992154539,29-Mar-24
WWE Champions,I can't even access my faction due to that stupid connection error bug. It's been 12 hours since I raised the ticket and no one has responded to me yet. I am in the top 80 faction but I can't participate in the faction boss. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but now not only im facing that issue  my straps  medals  moments  and the skill plates are all gone too. You don't even deserve 1 star.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999719322,25-Feb-24
WWE Champions,Fun game. Just moves to fast and a huge money grab. Unless you plan on spending thousands yes i said thousands you will not keep up on the new characters they introduce and you will not be able to do special events. They have vastly expanded the selection of characters and have given out few carrots in the past year. Still need a full time job to keep up.,NEGATIVE,1,0.968179464,1-Mar-24
WWE Champions,Been glitching out alot but I do love the game it's too much glitching keeps giving internal server error when. Trying to start any battles aside from the showdown mind u I have spent money in this game heavily kinda annoying I can't enjoy the game now it's been a dang week.,NEGATIVE,1,0.984739184,28-Mar-24
WWE Champions,I've been playing since the game launched and I can finally say that the game is finally functioning well without constant issues of some sort. Boss Battle has long overdue been made enjoyable with the navigation and set-up issues taken care of. Faction Feud remains the flagship event  It's running well let's keep it up. Blitz seems to have found their place. Showdown unfortunately has become pay to win. I'm afraid it's only going to get worse. Get rid of Energy for Showdown! It's unnecessary!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.990689754,12-Dec-23
WWE Champions,I keep getting stuck on the  choose account  screen before it reloads to go back to choose account. I'm level 35 & 9  and I can't even do ANYTHING at all now. I HAVE contacted them through email.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998128593,12-Apr-24
WWE Champions,Slow gaming mode  good features  explore menus to maximize your roles  slow pvp mode and friend support  love this game as flexibility of playing time  anywhere and anytime. Developer notes : Keep enhance the menu to ease players experience. Glitch in old android/old iphone.,POSITIVE,0,0.988650203,20-Apr-24
WWE Champions,So it's a wwe puzzle  rpg  candy crushy Mashup. With the worst gacha system. well 'pity' varies btwn 50-70 (only if you pull it all  once  it doesn't build up) . AND CURRENCY IS NOT OBTAINABLE. You can only get it with real money. And one costs a dollar and every pulling gives leaderboard points on whatever event is going on. The monthly 'Free' banner is filled w trash cards and you still don't get enough keys for the guarantee. One of many awful things btw  paywalls aplenty in this one.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999703348,10-Apr-24
WWE Champions,Is a fun pass time game. Problem it is loaded with absurd prices and too many subscriptions held within. That spells money hungry but with that aside it is fun. Graphics are nice and the flow smooth. The gameplay is good however  the game suddenly cannot read the WiFi or any Internet connection and It is not because of my internet. It simply choose when it doesn't want to work anymore. Disappointing for a game that has free time promise.,POSITIVE,0,0.921528339,25-Nov-23
WWE Champions,This is not good  I spent a lot of money here for loot. All these years I don't even get a 6 star superstar  to all these competitions I don't even have one superstar for these competitions. Now I just open and close the game  because I don't have any  we can't spend a lot of money like that and only get 50 shads or 100 shads  you guys are draining us. This sucks ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.998533487,9-Apr-24
WWE Champions,Fun game been playing for around 6 years. It takes time to get superstars leveled up and you repeatedly get the same superstars over and over again which can be helpful if you don't have a lot of training points as their posters double as a way to increase you move power. Of course it's a money grab like all mobile games but if you like puzzles and wrestling this is the game for you.,POSITIVE,0,0.996668637,6-Jan-24
WWE Champions,Not even opening. Downloaded but still not even opening it is showing some glitch. Number of times I am opening it no.of times it is restarting.Worst game I have ever player yuck it sucks. I have proper internet and I have already cleared chache many times I have enough memory space too but the app is not opening.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999621034,7-Apr-24
WWE Champions,Actually one of the best pvp games out there. Few bugs and they usually do try to compensate when things do go wrong. Fun game. Not even much p2p. It still helps but they do enough that a normal person can enjoy without pouring hundreds into it,POSITIVE,0,0.999505401,7-Apr-24
WWE Champions,It was a good game for a long time but every update make it worst than previous versions. After updating  enabling update is very difficult. It waste alot of time and now I'm uninstalling the game. ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.999670267,12-Apr-24
WWE Champions,Was running good until I got to Naomi. She does the feel the glow that I assume is a submission because the characters don't move but you can still play until you break the submission and the game freezes,NEGATIVE,1,0.743308246,21-Apr-24
WWE Champions,Great game; monetization is fair (you'll spend to get to elite tiers; but can have fun for free if occasional relaxed play is your thing). HOWEVER... THE CRASHES AND FREEZES ARE CONSTANT. It's a fun quick game. Long load times + freezes makes a rec impossible. Stability has been an ongoing issue. Not sure fixing it is a dev priority.,POSITIVE,0,0.984253526,25-Nov-23
WWE Champions,YAY PAY TO WIN! Unless you like losing and being locked out of many events because you dont have the right wrestlers  stay away if you are poor because you will almost NEVER EVER get a 6 star wrestler unless you buy one with cold hard cash! This is a rich man's game and developers need to get paid.,NEGATIVE,1,0.860014558,10-Apr-24
WWE Champions,I like this game very much  I've been enjoying it since it's release. It's much better than WWE Mayhem. I just have a request that can you add Cody Rhodes in the game because I've seen many other new WWE superstars but It would be awesome if you would add old WWE superstars as it would attract more fans of WWE. adding old superstars would make the game more interesting to play. So please do so for us so we can enjoy the game and play with peace.,POSITIVE,0,0.999521494,17-Feb-24
WWE Champions,Please fix the bugs ð¦ ð¦ ð¦  Edit1: There was an option of create lobby in the boss battle which is really improved now  so I'm going to give 4 stars to this game and before i gave it 3 because of bugs...still more improvements needed than i will give 5 stars..ð¤ð»,POSITIVE,0,0.912480235,19-Mar-24
WWE Champions,Amazing game but one suggestion to make EVERYONE happy! PLEASE let everyone trade in ALL their unused loot. I have unused loot from years ago. My ocd is killing me seeing all of it just sitting there. Let us trade in the ENTIRE unused loot. You have no idea how happy you'd make every single player. Thanks guys.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998718619,12-Mar-24
WWE Champions,This is overall a great game tons of superstars on the roster a great puzzle to solve and fun thrilling action the only thing that would make it better is if you added thier theme songs to the soundtrack and or entrances,POSITIVE,0,0.981043637,29-Mar-24
WWE Champions,Had an issue where my account got changed and after one message and all details provided within  they were able to recover my account.

WWE Champions,Aside from occasional connection issues and freezing  the game has been enjoyable. Couple of suggestion  though: - reissue some of the original characters  only update them a little to compete against the newer characters  - any possibility of installing a translation mode to communicate with foreign faction members so we can all understand each other? Been using Google Translation  but some of the words won't post on chat and would have to tweak it a little.,POSITIVE,0,0.877853394,6-Jan-24
WWE Champions,I liked this game alot until I started to link my account to there website well every since I've been checking the website I've got a lot of stuff said it was sent to my in game inbox well its been over 2 weeks I don't even get the free claims but when u message them they want u to name everything u claim u should have gotten but when they message back they say they can't help u and give u a health pack even if some of the stuff u got is worth money but hope they fix it and I'd give more *,NEGATIVE,1,0.994192541,2-Apr-24
WWE Champions,Hope you get sued for running a scam...can't win 99% of fights and events cause they rig fights to get you to spend money...which is a pay for play game...they deliberately put items in the store you can't get to confuse you to spend money...and even if you spend money  you can't win fights cause they are rigged...so it's a lose lose for you and a win win for them cause either way your spending money and losing...my advice do not dowload and go to wwe games where you will get your money worth...,NEGATIVE,1,0.996582448,27-Apr-24

WWE Champions,Glitches often. Specifically women's tour chapter 3 1st match against Naomi. Her finisher causes the game to get stuck on them just stepping around forcing us to quit the match and injure our wrestler,NEGATIVE,1,0.998228133,23-Apr-24
WWE Champions,This game has gone bad to absolutely worst every event games have s-tier superstar has enemy and even smallest of the superstar has heavy amount of damage and Showdown are the worst this game decides which roaster superstar we have to use and other opponents doesn't use same ones maybe they paid money to this game so end of the day everything is about money and these developers have no shame in showing partiality towards them worst game ever no wonder most players are leaving this stupid game ð¨,NEGATIVE,1,0.999752343,23-Apr-24

WWE Champions,It's safe to say that this game has grown on me. FYI  my last comment was not wrong or a hasteful review. Limited time event drive people crazy. Developers have made sure that users won't get premium rewards right away with coughing up some cash. However  I found this game really tests your wits. U C I was able to beat bobby lashley in hell mode of authors of april with 2 star Akam. But I didn't get my bonus reward because Akam was not 5 star atleast.,NEGATIVE,1,0.69043684,20-Apr-24

WWE Champions,Game play is lacking even for a puzzle game. My biggest pet peeve is that the game will pin the opponent when you make too many matches too fast. This can give the opponent an advantage after a 5 gem match  letting them have a  wild  gem to break the pin and giving them your turn. All in all  not worth the time and definitely not worth any money.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99970299,5-Jan-24
WWE Champions,Everything is al a carte despite great game play. For every different part of the game there is a new subscription... I took part in the VIP but there's also DX army  Managers  so on and so forth... I enjoy the game but I can't afford Everything and it's becoming apparent that other than the base career portion is pay to play.

WWE Champions,This game is garbage I had if for 7+ years I'm a wrestling fan forever tho. they give you garbage AZZ wrestlers if you are from a family of poverty. The game requires like a good 5 g phone of it will lag horribly. It makes your phone get overheated did that to two of my phones . ð² No coincidence but it's a dirty game very shady.

WWE Champions,If you're not dropping at least $99/week you will have no chance. Do you remember when Flappy Bird got heat for making money on ads? Scopely is demonic. Bankrupt through micro transactions. Own nothing. Be happy. You'll also be forced to use females. Female wrestling is boring and slow. We try to pretend it's not cuz we like bikinis  but we ultimately don't let men wrestle women because the women would look bad.

WWE Champions,It's pretty frustrating that you can plunk down $300 on a pull (yes $300  you read that right) and walk away with just shards for the featured card. Its not even pay-to-win anymore... I'm just paying and getting garbage pulls of useless fodder. Maybe its a fluke - another $300 pull and more shards. For perspective  I paid $600 and only 25% of the needed shards to recruit the featured card. Don't be fooled  if there's a chance you can be screwed in pulls  you will be.

If you are in the middle of the match it is automatically a loss and support is useless,NEGATIVE,1,0.999791086,12-Dec-23

WWE Champions,Game is fun but developers don't help as much as they should and it can be very frustrating at time with poor rewards for hard work but it's a decent game to pass time if you don't let it stress you has improved over time better drops are still hard to come by but definitely heading in right direction,POSITIVE,0,0.999145746,25-Nov-23
WWE Champions,Been playing this game for some years and it's just gotten worse. Freezes during matches and when you restart the game youve lost all your health. And why do you penalize the player when your game is the one that crashed. I understand you have to make money but this is ridiculous. All the monthly subscriptions equal $120+. With all the negatives reviews and complaints scamely still won't resolve the matter.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99973613,21-Dec-23
WWE Champions,Still having issues with support. If something goes wrong its just a  glitch  but arent those the kind of things that support should compensate for.

Scopely customer service not easy to deal with plus said the could help help me...too lazy,NEGATIVE,1,0.99848938,6-Jan-24
WWE Champions,A good base game but too many real dollars need to be spent to progress. I mean  I looked at the Portal Website and there is an offer for like 1000 bucks for rubies. What tickles me most though  is the fact that only real money purchases are unlimited. Any currency available for free via contest medallions are limited. Purchasing props from the prizewall: limited. Purchasing in game cash with real money: unlimited. See what I mean? But I've been playing since 2016 when it was f2p. Don't get!!!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.988441825,11-Jan-24
WWE Champions,This game is so misleading because in the commercial they show that they talk and they don't. So this game is just nothing more than a game of bejeweled with WWE Stars. Plus you have to spend a lot of real money to get what you want. It's a it's a gimmick. I rather play WWE 2K on my Xbox x. This game is dull and boring and I've only played it for 10 minutes. I'm already bored so just remember they don't talk and it's not worth it. So hard pass,NEGATIVE,1,0.999661446,30-Jan-24
WWE Champions,About to uninstall this game because every time I starting winning showdown they put restrictions on it then again I win then again they put restrictions then they say it provides challenge how is it supposed to be challenge when my opponents are stronger than me and am restricted also you have to invest to get higher tier superstar or they mostly opens shards in the loot its very annoying.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995405793,9-Jan-24
WWE Champions,I think it's a really good game. I think what would be nice as if you kept doing the season mode. Like other games  throw in like a cage match. Throwing a first blood match. There's a lot of areas. This place can go and it would be nice if you could throw on the classic entrance titan trones,POSITIVE,0,0.992896616,22-Jan-24
WWE Champions,Don't waste your time with this garbage. This is the most pay to win WWE game ever. You only get Cena  Roman and Rock. But if you want new people you have to spend money otherwise don't even bother. They didn't make this game for people struggling. Unless you have no life you have to grind all day just to get somewhat closer to getting a new loot box which doesn't even give you a guaranteed superstar. This game is terrible.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995991766,23-Dec-23
WWE Champions,Game crashes mid match constantly causing the app to close and I lose all progress and rewards and my superstar ends up injured. ***UPDATE**** Since writing this review the game has crashed now 4 times mid match  tried all the fixes suggested which all failed.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999740422,19-Jan-24
WWE Champions,it still become frozen and unresponsive once I reached league no. 10. Once I restart it over again it's the same old thing. Please fix this. I wish it was offline so I could progress further without using wifi or internet connection,NEGATIVE,1,0.999280155,25-Nov-23
WWE Champions,The game has glitches  and scoply use to be pretty good at giving you rewards that you didn't receive  but now they don't.

WWE Champions,It's really disappointing to see that feedback given has never given a proper response. After all the emails I have sent out to your team for improving the game. All I get back in response is can't promise & has informed the developer team. Not even once the developer of the game has reached out to me to understand problem. Or to listen to ideas and suggestions. After seeing this review you will ask me to email to customer service back and forth. Hope for once to see a positive response.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997989774,9-Jan-24
Last Island of Survival,1) Playing after a month or two  now the game has become too much heavy than before even tho i am playing with same device as before with 4gb Ram. Its too much laggy  like game freezes for 1-2 seconds and then unfreezes. Its so much annoying especially in fights. Please fix this issue. 2) Undead Miners are flying most of the time and sometimes when we get close to them they comes down slowly but most of the time they are in the sky levitatingð¤·ââï¸. 3) It takes too much internetð 4) Optimize Gam,NEGATIVE,1,0.999488354,15-May-22
Last Island of Survival,Hi. I came to write my review today about bugs and bugs  bugs... Honestly I don't really care about any bugs but all I want is for you guys... To fix the Base Bugs. Like when placing a bomb on a wall or something it doesn't take damage. It's an old bug  but it's still not fix. I hope your reading this  and I hope you're going to fix it in the next update. I would've given it a 5 star if only if it weren't for the Wall roof and other bug that can't take damage when placing a bomb. That's all thx.,NEGATIVE,1,0.991232097,27-Apr-24
Last Island of Survival,Not very impressed so far. Very confusing  some stuff only written in Chinese  can barely keep up resources to maintain the walls and ceilings. Dare to venture to an area with any potential supplies and you're a sitting duck. Absolutely ð¯ cash grab  garbage game. Update: dropped it to1 star and the game is now deleted  terrible game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999753416,27-Apr-24
Last Island of Survival,This is the best look alike to RUST which is an amazing game on PC that I've never got to experience but this game is similar to it  love how it runs on my low end device. So much to do in the game. Only problem is minor bugs like shots not registering  as if the hit box is small and also when using the shotgun at times it doesn't go off. Another problem is the game is a bit pay to win which makes it unfair to others who can't fund the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.98691386,17-Feb-24
Last Island of Survival,This game is far from perfect it has its problems. It's exactly what you would expect a survival game. So expect to lose things on death when you die. expect hostile players and having to watch your back constantly when in game . It feels like a mobile version of rust but third person.. This game has gotten me through a hard time in my life. I enjoy the building the survival and having to constantly be alert when in the game. It's really helped with my focus. I give it 4 stars.,POSITIVE,0,0.965446115,18-Mar-24
Last Island of Survival,Game has a lot if bugs now. Player movement is off like crazy. Hit boxes are off also. There's still a very big problem with hackers. Server connection issues. So many bugs it's almost unplayable. In my opinion. But games is still one of the best mobile survival games out there. Wish they would add voice chat. Really sucks without it.,POSITIVE,0,0.969688773,8-Mar-24
Last Island of Survival,I've always really enjoyed playing this game. I played a lot of games like grim survival  and rust but this one gives you the most experienced towards what it would be like at the end of the world. You can see the different types of survival instincts of people like drifters that move around on the map sleeping wherever  to people who would try to recover technology. All forms of psychology is seen in this game  people taking great risk to build friendships and trust  to manipulation survival.,POSITIVE,0,0.996306658,28-Dec-23
Last Island of Survival,I love the game... Its very bad for cheating on public and random private lobbies  but for less than Â£30 you can make your own server and control it without issue. It's a must have if you love open world hunt and build with a complex building system for amazing creations. When the cheating is sorted you will have a hard time finding a games like this on mobile.,POSITIVE,0,0.964561045,28-Dec-23
Last Island of Survival,I love this game. Been playing it for over a year  but the new upgrades. Are what's wrong with the game? It should be Fair to all players. Advanced players should have their own map. Give us the option to choose an advancement to be aggressive on  but give us that choice if we don't have the normal upgrades like everybody else. I work hard for a week. Building make up my place sufficient. Then somebody comes with a dragon that flies through the sky. Easily destroying my home it's wrong,NEGATIVE,1,0.996200502,29-Feb-24
Last Island of Survival,Good experience. Respect. But there's a few things to improve. For example  the  status effect  button  in the  controls menu  is massive on the screen  but I only want to adjust the little button that I to press to expand. On the other note  this game is the closest  Rust Mobile  game you'll ever get. Also  it would be amazing if you guys included a first person / third person option. It would really make this game a 10/10,POSITIVE,0,0.995165706,14-Apr-24
Last Island of Survival,Quite good  though had some annoying issues: firstly- latency issue= sometimes laggy or delay  got hit even when im out of their hitbox. Second- unfair dangerous status  it adds unjustifiable gps tracking to whoever defends themselves- they got attacked first  why would they be dangerous. Some issues might be ridiculous spawning of enemy players next to your settlement  rendering defense completely a chore because they just zerg rush you.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99663204,27-Mar-24
Last Island of Survival,No actual tutorial there's people who have much higher rank than a newbie learning. Constantly getting killed while trying to upgrade and get materials to upgrade  it's not a game that is very fun due to the disrespectful players that can't stop killing even when you ask them to stop. It's more stressful trying to learn because again no tutorial in game to teach. Chances of getting killed 100% of the time. If I could actually learn cool but high powered disrespectful people vs Newbies No.,NEGATIVE,1,0.981488883,24-Feb-24
Last Island of Survival,not really beginner friendly and most of all you build up so far and lose your base after sometime and has so much high maintenance requirements in such short time not only that but hackers can take your things regardless and is not fair in some sense when you just worked so hard to get where you are in my view it seems pointless  uninstalling the game and finding something that more potential and fair on all parts I get survival games but this just seems to much with little progress,NEGATIVE,1,0.999665976,16-Apr-24
Last Island of Survival,This game is Good  but i just want to ask how can you fix the Device Banned for 10years? Like  Me and my friend is playing all the time then he Quit because of Phone problem  then after he came back  his account and device was Banned? Its ok if months   but 10years.

Last Island of Survival,Seriously long game . Very good for mobile andriod . Is basically a lite version of rust . Has huge potential with community based games . Good game needs to polish team work and other types of in game mechanic play. Good graphics. Indepth base build. Pugb combat  needs music and better sound ambient will massively boost game enjoyment and interactive play. . Simple update to more sounds. would transform game potential.

Last Island of Survival,Great game and great game play. Graphics are pretty decent to. I like the construction building system in the game. Also the thought of having to stay alert at all times gives the game an exciting thrill to it. ITS A GREAT GAME TO PLAY IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A SURVIVAL GAME WITH LOTS OF SOCIAL INTERACTING SURVIVALING TO IT.

Last Island of Survival,READ BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD. In the beginning of this game you will feel hopeful. As you progress and figure out some of the basics  you will then need to spend 100-500 usd to compete. Pegasus the flying horse  wing gliders. This game took all the bad parts of ARK Survival evolved and made them a pay to win mechanic. Breaks my heart but I just deleted. Spent 120 usd and still can not compete with the talent system or the pet system. Please focus on your mental well being and do not download this.,NEGATIVE,1,0.990161061,2-Apr-24
Last Island of Survival,This game is horrible every time you try to shoot someone. It doesn't do damage. The hitboxes are extremely buggy and so is building. It will randomly take your materials and you can't get them back so you have to farm more. This game is also very very paid to win You can literally buy health. You can buy pretty much anything this game is very bad and I would not recommend it for anyone,NEGATIVE,1,0.985538483,19-Jan-24
Last Island of Survival,It was a fun game with friends. Unfortunately  after getting a new phone  I can't seem to transfer my game data (Huawei ID to Google ID) despite giving proof of purchase in Google Play and using the same email on both Huawei and Google account.

Last Island of Survival,I'm having a hard time equipping the bionic pets I also lost a mountain bike I would like to get a refund on that or a second opportunity to repurchase it.

Last Island of Survival,Actually  I love the concept of being survival and everything. I played this with my husband and we made really strong home for us but when we have passed so many quest and we did it so well and when we away suddenly our home demolished and some people can easier to looth our things. We have spent 3 days built so strong home and full security. Always and always when we get high level suddenly broke down. It made us so fed up so we decided will never played at all.,NEGATIVE,1,0.983966291,17-Mar-24
Last Island of Survival,Good game but it's just that people way higher than level than you kill you so many glitches and can't even play for an hour without dieing to over leveled person not tutorials nothing and game can't even process gunshots like I shot someone in the head with a sniper rifle and it doesn't even kill and also put 40 pistol bullets into a person while enemys always just walk up to me with stone axe it one shots me DO NOT PLAY,NEGATIVE,1,0.993957877,1-Mar-24
Last Island of Survival,If i could rate this 0 star i would. the game just keeps getting worse. what you did to the talent system is criminal you butchered one of the last few good points in the game you made it so talent points cannot be distributed without paying to get slots. such a disgrace you are still limiting players to such degree and extorting soo much money in exchange for a buggy  glitchy  and hacker filled game without improvement and only adding pay to win craps. Too greedy and too incompetent.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999801338,27-Feb-24
Last Island of Survival,This game is mad good graphic and all round good game but the only thing is their is not enough solo servicers and their needs to be lower pop servicers and the zombies in the game need to be removed would love the game if use fixed the bugs and make some solo servers and ones that r not moded plz if use can fix these problems I'll be happy to give use a five stars till then staying at three stars,NEGATIVE,1,0.973421872,25-Mar-24
Last Island of Survival,This is a really great game I've honestly haven't seen a game like this on mobile  but there are so many bugs like my game crashing and it's so annoying because I have lost so much stuff by that.

Last Island of Survival,First if all this game is pay to win  makes it very hard for beginners. even old players are having a rough time. Buy skins to increase ur dmg  increase hp which basically means easy 1v1 etc.. Not to mention the bugs that never got fixed and won't get fixed anytime soon. People can build a ramp and jump with a horse on top of any base. Like what's the point of building high if a simple glitch ruines everything? 0/5 stars imo. And don't tell me to join ur discord. Even ur Mods aren't active there,NEGATIVE,1,0.999086261,24-Feb-24
Last Island of Survival,Impossible to play if new admins will give you gifts only to attack and take them back constant attacks when new high levels don't let up building is impossible you have to have a base but since low levels are constantly targeted you don't get to even get through the guide stuff to get your own server would cost around $100 USD could be great but it's just bully's and trolls in game no way to rank up,NEGATIVE,1,0.999610722,15-Mar-24
Last Island of Survival,Terrible first experience  it let me customize my hair color then it stayed grey and you can't change it. Then the game froze on the first screen three times  didn't even get to hit play. I have a new device so obviously seems part of the bugs everyone else talks about.

Last Island of Survival,I really like this game in my opinion  but there is 2 things that I don't really like and that is the fact how  I always have to scavenge for spare  and I'm pretty sure the only way to obtain spare is by destroying oil drums  wich is very repetitive and slow in my opinion and also whenever I make 10 cans with meat in the camp fire for some reason it still gives me the arcane cuisine dish  wich is really weird because I did exactly what is said.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999166369,28-Nov-23
Last Island of Survival,Pretty much an average experience. This game is basically p2w Rust. There's some flaws with the building. In example your base is pretty much vulnerable when you start because the only way to protect it is crafting a code lock but for that you need to have 50 iron ingots which is quite a lot of time obtaining and trough all that time everyone can enter in your base to raid you. There are also some other flaws which I don't have enough space to mention. Overall not very great.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999676824,29-Nov-23
Last Island of Survival,In many ways this was a fun game. You had open world to play  very good graphics  not too difficult nor too easy to play.

With that being said I feel this game needs an entire new work through  you have created and become something else entirely from anything where it started. the unbalancing has peeked  100%  Pay to win and only rewards to earn are all time limit loot.

Last Island of Survival,This game is 100% pay to win and it's bogus. It's literally impossible to win a server against people who have spent 1000s of dollars to max their talents. (You won't win pvps without max talents)Bought upgraded guns that do more damage. People who have bought the rocket car in which there's no base you can build to survive against it  people who have bought mechas.

Fishdom,Overall: fun  visually appealing  no ads (rare for a free game). Unfortunately  with the last update it's impossible to replay/reshuffle the board having made no moves. While I understand that it's supposed to be this  clever strategy  to make us spend power ups faster  it had the opposite effect  because I know they'll be most likely positioned in a useless place and will be a waste. A shame  because I used to spend lots.. and now it's just frustrating so I end up playing less and less..,NEGATIVE,1,0.99880743,15-Apr-24
Fishdom,This game IS fun. Impressed by all the different things you do. Favorite is building aquariums. No ads Yes...BUT they make it so hard you HAVE to use tools (which cost money) to get through the puzzles. LoL even then much much of the time it's not enough so you have to pay 9 gems for 5 more moves! If you DO NOT buy a monthly pass  you are given very few moves (not even 15) most of the time. When you buy the pass you get a whopping 5 extra moves. Fun but IT COSTS A LOT. $$$$$$$$,NEGATIVE,1,0.970897496,29-Apr-24
Fishdom,Pay to Progress. You will have to spend money to progress. The normal levels become impossible to beat without boosters. So you can only imagine what the hard and super hard ones are like. When you do use boosters they are not so randomly placed. In places that are useless in most cases. This game is a fix to get you to spend money. I wouldn't suggest installing. Time for me to uninstall.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999422312,27-Apr-24
Fishdom,Looks like the most recent update causes you to lose a booster if you quit before making your first move on a level. You just lost a user over that ridiculous change (and one with 10 000+ levels completed). I'm confident I won't be the only one either. If something comes up and you need to back out of a level before starting  you shouldn't be penalized for it. Bad move. I didn't feel like this app was a cash grab until now.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999674201,17-Apr-24
Fishdom,This game presents some challenging levels  which require funds to progress. It is exceedingly difficult to progress in these hard levels with the number of attempts available. I find it disappointing that players are required to establish a Facebook account. Despite my age and loss of interest in Facebook  why would players be encouraged to set up an account within the game? I appreciate the aquatic theme and the gameplay. However  I am not fond of the concept of spending.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998771846,14-Apr-24
Fishdom,The algorithms to make money couldn't be more obvious. If you lose a level it's rare that it's not because you need just one more move  that you can buy with real money. If you can't beat a level  just stop playing for awhile and you magically beat it with more moves to spare. You also used to be able to restart levels without using lives  to get a more favorable board (even though levels are based on chance  not skill) and they've stopped that. The game is no longer fun.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999176323,10-Apr-24
Fishdom,The latest update has ruined my hobby. They took away the ability to quit a level & restart without penalty of losing bonuses. I've been playing this on & off for a long time. I'm @ 10K+ levels. I started playing because it was free of ads. Initially disappointed  like others  that the puzzles seen in ads were not the primary game. Over time I have given in & spent $ - more than I care to admit. (Does that make me an addict? Probably since I'm over 10K levels.) But now I'm done.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999680519,10-Apr-24
Fishdom,The new update causes you to lose a life and any boosters you may have if you quit a level before making the first move. That is really  really frustrating. Also  the booster options normally switch from  seasong  to   lucky horseshoe' and back over the course of a few days  but my seashell event timer keeps starting over. Yesterday it said there were 20 hours left of the sea song boosters  and now it says there are 2 days and 19 hours. Why??,NEGATIVE,1,0.99927932,29-Apr-24
Fishdom,Addictive but this app is all about making money. They used to have fun mini games and fun side quest like decorating/upgrading rooms  but now they always have the 2 same side quest. When you start a new level and you have forgotten to use a power up  you used to be able to restart the level without losing a life but now you do. They just want your money. Don't download this game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.979658961,12-Apr-24
Fishdom,Started really fun  the game is really addictive and the best part is there are no ads. But here comes the tricky part. As you advance the game  it becomes pay-to-play  and as soon as you bought something the game will target you and makes it impossible for you to advance without boosters. Great potential that ended up being disappointing. Also  the last season event  firework festival  cannot be completed without buying gems  since you are running out of giftwrap set. That was the end for me.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99783057,11-Apr-24
Fishdom,FACT: when you go to facebook click on all comments as the negative ones are filtered out. 8 years of playing & they reward us with less gems in the fishy bank and higher store prices. The season pass is $6.99 USD. This is all about money now. I miss the old game. It was awesome when the season pass first came out. 04/14/24 UPDATE on game has made all levels extremely hard. Also  they stopped the ability to back out of a level to line power ups.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997837007,14-Apr-24
Fishdom,I have played this game for years. It used to be an enjoyable pass time. Now they continually update it to get the players to spend money. This used to be a game you could play and move throughthe levels. Now  the levels are more difficult  and the jewels needed to pass them continually cost more money. The team structure is wonderful as a way to connect with people worldwide. The guilt you feel not passing levels for your team is very real.,POSITIVE,0,0.999278367,12-Apr-24
Fishdom,Lack of functionality to replay levels punctuates poor decision making driven by pay-to-win design. Saturated with hasty design decisions. Would it take more time and pay more to see power ups explode one by one? Yes. And they don't explode when you lose. Why? Because care and attention take a distant second base to fun. Can't save and replay favorite levels so you never really own a license to enjoy the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999715388,7-Apr-24
Fishdom,It's so annoying that if you get called away in the middle of a level  or have to restart  it doesn't save your progress it just says you lost. Also having played a couple thousand levels now  I can definitely say that it is programmed just perfectly so that you almost always need *just one more* move than you have to beat the level. It is good for wasting time though.,NEGATIVE,1,0.977916956,23-Mar-24
Fishdom,Game is fun. But customer service isn't great. Had trouble with progress after switching device. They helped. Then it had issues connecting  so it said to reinstall again. I did that  but game progress was lost. Apparently they can only help you once. What the heck? Their article told me to do that when restarting the phone didn't work. Do better.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998538136,14-Mar-24
Fishdom,Developers making it less interesting and more difficult with every update! Now you can't check out the level  before spending boosters. They want you to waste your boosters. When the game was actually great (long time ago)   with tasks etc.. it was fun to play and I bought the pass every month  but absolutely not want to spend a penny now on this game!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999294519,15-Apr-24
Fishdom,I reached level 6 and.... nothing  nothing to do  no direction  no hints  just a screen with 2 fish  and occasionally a turtle swims through  but just a dead end! No need to try to explain whatever you're supposed to do to be able to keep playing  I've uninstalled it and it's too much trouble to have to go to support just to know how to advance the gameplay.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997772276,16-Apr-24
Fishdom,Enjoyable game  but can be frustrating when you get stuck on a level for 2 days or more just because the game doesn't give you the tools you need to defeat a certain level. Of course it's set up to frustrate you into paying real-world money on it  but I've managed to get up beyond level 11 500 without spending a cent on it  so stick with it.,POSITIVE,0,0.622158945,13-Apr-24
Fishdom,With this new update you can no longer exit a level before making a move without losing a life and any boosters you had. I've been playing this game for years and have spent a lot of time and money to get where I am in the game. Taking our ability away to attempt to set ourselves up in a more strategic way before starting a level is just another way for you to get players to spend more money by having to use and therefore pay for more boosters and diamonds. It's not even fun to play anymore.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999020815,13-Apr-24
Fishdom,Used to be good. Used to be a really fun game which was occasionally challenging  now it seems to be really challenging & occasionally fun. The levels are mostly hard or super hard and it's just to get you to purchase diamonds or extra things to help you beat a level. Some levels have taken me 20+ attempts to solve & I quit for a few days  it's frustrating & I don't know why I keep playing it! I should delete it but I keep hoping they will fix the problem & make it easier again. Here's hoping.,NEGATIVE,1,0.951806784,10-Mar-24
Fishdom,I strongly recommend you make it possible to skip a level. I'm stuck on level 114 and may uninstall if I can't beat it. Any way to skip a level  even if it's heinous  even if you have to  like  watch three ads to do it  would be an improvement. I guarantee you get more ad revenue from people who keep playing than by losing people because there's no way at all to pass a level without beating it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998563826,30-Mar-24
Fishdom,I love Fishdom. I am addicted to it. It has only been 2 days  yet I cannot stop myself from hardcore grinding levels. The game is very interactive  and has multiple tasks going on  such as minigames  races among players  and milestones to complete. However  I do find that at the beginning of the game  there was a much higher variety within the minigames  and as of recent  I have only been getting a certain kind. I also cannot pass level 169. My mental state suffers. Please help me.,POSITIVE,0,0.981594682,17-Mar-24
Fishdom,If I could give this 0 stars  I would. Game constantly out of sync when you make moves. Puzzle levels are nothing like the ad and are repetitive and too easy. Vs battle are a joke. How does someone go from zero to 5000+ in same time it takes you to complete 1dt level at 1st attempt You remove several lightning bolts and vlear a board only for it to not register any in your score. There are far better match up games out there than this one.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99950552,24-Apr-24
Fishdom,It is used to be fun  but each upgrade change makes it harder to win and need to spend money  even the easy levels algorithm works such that you barely lose and can pay for more lives. Doesn't give you items as it used  and the latest change makes so you can't start over without losing a life. better apps out there.,NEGATIVE,1,0.941396058,15-Apr-24
Fishdom,At first I was enjoying the game and it became addictive. But now that I've surpassed level 300  it's just frustrating. I've noticed a regular bias with the game algorithm as it places the boosters very inconveniently when they decide they don't want you to win. This has happened frequently. Edit: just got cheated on the battle  no points awarded whilst winning a level insanely well. They definitely pick who wins these battles. Also the algorithm has gotten worse and unfair.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99796021,25-Apr-24
Fishdom,Game starts off easy enough  but quickly reaches a point where the only way to progress is spend money. Just like Candy Crush and all the games like it  they SEVERELY limit the number of moves you have to complete a puzzle to the point it just isn't even fun to play. I feel sorry for people that no longer get to experience games without all the greedy micro purchase tactics. LAME! In response to developer - YEAH RIGHT LOL! I'm not spending a month trying to get lucky to beat a puzzle.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999710262,22-Apr-24
Fishdom,Nice game  however the new price of â¬ 6.99 for season pass is too expensive  the previous price was â¬4.99  they raised the price for no reason.. Moreover  it becomes even more difficult to pass the levels  I barely make it to the middle of the pass. So you never get what you paid for  unless you buy additional weapons.. No  thanks  not anymore...This is my biggest disappointment.. 4 stars..,NEGATIVE,1,0.999280512,3-Mar-24
Fishdom,If you're reading these reviews to decide if you want to play or not... DON'T. Developers  you've taken this game from a fun way to pass time to an obvious money grab. You're losing players and profits will follow. I used to have no problem with dropping a couple dollars to collect my  winnings   but now that levels can't be won without buying 35 extra turns  I'm done. No less than 8 days stuck on the same level and I refuse to pay more.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99952662,19-Apr-24
Fishdom,I love the game  I've been playing it for years but recently it has made me win the same levels multiple times and when it gives me free bombs for 10mins it only let's me use about 3mins of it and then they disappear. If the game developers can't fix the bugs in their game  then Ill delete it. I am on level 8 470 and always gave a 5 start review until today. All they want is for people to spend as much money as possible but free stuff they are giving away isn't working its not right .,NEGATIVE,1,0.998728096,21-Apr-24
Fishdom,Greedy & controlling! They find every way possible to screw over players. They now removed the ability to back out of boards when boosters aren't well placed. In a game that is supposed to be computer generated  random chance players already feel like it is rigged against them. The ability to not make a move until the boosters we earned were in locations we felt would give us the best shot at beating the board was the 1 and only bit of control we had  but they took it away. Absolutely appalling!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999735177,14-Apr-24
Fishdom,Unfair advantage for some. Either give super lightening for all or none. I won't spend another dollar until you guys figure out there are a lot of people without super lightening. This  test  has been going on for over a month  at this point I'm giving the finger right back. You can get money from the select few with super lightening. Apparently you don't need mine.,NEGATIVE,1,0.993849814,6-Apr-24
Fishdom,When you get stuck on a level it is nearly impossible to beat it. I'm on level 151 and I've done it 10+ times and it still has not given me a way to beat it without spending my money on gems  and it shouldn't cost a dollar for 10 gems just to get enough to beat ONE level. They need to have a way to get gems easier and make buying extra moves with gems cheaper. It's a charming game  but it's frustrating not having a clear way to beat a level,NEGATIVE,1,0.855781496,14-Apr-24
Fishdom,I really enjoy the game. It's a great distraction. I don't like that the puzzle stage is always the same. I have not gotten the fish eating fish puzzle like advertised. Also you are forced to play the target level. The target level should be optional (especially if you lose all power-ups and only have one chance to win.,NEGATIVE,1,0.82282567,21-Apr-24
Fishdom,Overall  it's a fun game. My ONLY issue is that some levels  no matter what you do  you absolutely cannot beat unless you spend money because the number of moves they give you  makes it IMPOSSIBLE to beat!!! That really misses me off!!! That's why I unistalled before. Makes me want to donit again...,NEGATIVE,1,0.982300222,20-Apr-24
Fishdom,This game used to be fun a couple of years ago. It was possible to enjoy playing the game even if having trouble passing difficult levels. You could complete mini challenges that would help you advance in the main challenge such as collect pearls  or detonate bombs & the mini challenges could be completed even if you didn't pass a level. Now if you do not pass levels there is no way to advance in the challenges. They are clearly just after money not encouraging people to play.,NEGATIVE,1,0.831198752,17-Mar-24
Fishdom,Really enjoyed at first and now on level 3800+ but the game a bit strange for some reason like normal level was harder than very hard level  the side quest is getting harder as well. Tried to keep playing on the same level too long  got bored already. Btw  for this lastest update if you re-start the game by didnt even move you still gonna lost the heart also. Dont wanna delete this out  what a shame.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999135196,17-Apr-24
Fishdom,Lately the game become more difficult to complete the task even tho u have use the boosters. The game type level also ridiculous  had to be more than 10 times attempt only to complete the easy/normal level. What's the point if u gave the limited moves complete with hard/super hard package  we use the boosters but still failed to complete the task?? It is just to provoke us to buy the gem instead?? U saying that this game is free & beatable? Only if u play with super lightning in each level!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999210715,24-Mar-24
Fishdom,NOT WORTH It used to be fun now just frustrating and stressful   lately more higher you get  levels are made impossible to pass by cutting number of moves in half of what players used to have 2 yrs ago and so many hard and very hard levels  almost more than regular ones . Probably a strategy to make us buy more crystals.Higher prices for season pass   but at the same time less helpfull boosters contained .,NEGATIVE,1,0.998504519,13-Apr-24
Fishdom,As the game gets more challenging you have to pay to play. Also they have these levels that are considered challenges that you only get one shot and cannot skip. So what that means If I get a power up to start each level and I lose a challenge I don't want to play cause I know I only got one shot I'll lose that power up for the next level when I actually need it,NEGATIVE,1,0.994519651,7-Mar-24
Fishdom,I keep losing my progress during the match events which is literally the only reason I'm playing the game. You can't speak to a human  just a bot that doesn't understand. So I'm done playing the game. The graphics are good and the fish can be funny at times  but I've spent literal money on a game that loses progress after an update so one star!,NEGATIVE,1,0.998153985,27-Feb-24
Fishdom,The app is now slightly less aggressive about getting you to log in to Facebook  but still very aggressive with popups trying to get you to make in-app purchases. But there are now a range of new bugs that the developers wish to ignore. E.g. making a match next to an object should activate the object  but under certain circumstances it doesn't. I've told the devs  who informed me that I'm right  but they refuse to investigate or try to fix the issues.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99788934,24-Apr-24
Fishdom,This is the worst game I've ever played. It use to be really fun and this was my favo game but now it's really really so so boring if you don't wanna be disappointed then never play this game please!! You can only win levels when they want you to win otherwise no matter how many diomands  boosters you use but you won't win. I'm stuck on a level about a month or may be more than a month but couldn't win yet I'm really really disappointed!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999401689,22-Apr-24
Fishdom,Latest updates are the worst one. This game was standing out different than Candy Crush because of the quiting the the game at start and fresh game playing without loosing 1 life. Now I lost interest in Playing with restriction of lossing life. Also  the sea song booster is permanently implemented. Other option of gaining the booster is removed which was better as we used to loose single booster after loosing the level. This is 2nd mistake done in this update. Keep earlier settings as it were.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999627471,26-Apr-24
Fishdom,It's a very interesting game to play but as you go higher the levels become difficult to complete and at some point I played a game for three days straight.. please stop making this game so difficult after all it's not like you're gonna get any money after winning... sometimes it irritates me and I think It's time to unstall it,NEGATIVE,1,0.998710871,20-Apr-24
Fishdom,This game used to be fun to play  the fish are so cute  even then it was greedy  it has just gotten worse  it takes days to beat one level.... Update:They give you free bombs to come back after you uninstall the game  when you run out of the free stuff it's over  takes weeks to win 1 level if your lucky unless you want to make purchases  I do not recomend this game!,NEGATIVE,1,0.99851054,6-Apr-24
Fishdom,The new updates meant I couldn't quit a level without losing my life even before starting the game. We only have 5 lives  and this will deter us from progressing further to the next level and stop us from playing longer. The season pass is increasing in price  and it's now for 20 days only. Why are developers so greedy? There are millions of games our there for free. Beware not to lose loyal players as this is very frustrating!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.997120142,14-Apr-24
Fishdom,This game used to be fun but now it is so hard to get gems  extras and finish each aquarium. I have played this game for years and redownload to start over and it is just boring now. There are more hard levels than before and you get stuck on them for days. The extra games are also pretty boring and hard to play after while too.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999627352,16-Apr-24
Fishdom,I used to love this game  but they took away the chance to restart for free if you haven't made a move. This has increased difficulty and frustration quite a bit. I'm forced to waste a life when I can tell I can't win with the initial setup. I'll still play but it's not worth it to spend money on anymore.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999646544,15-Apr-24
Fishdom,Was fun at first. They like to give you some really hard levels looking for you to spend real cash. Eventually you get to an impossible level that is frustrating. I don't play games to be frustrated  I play games to pass the time. I recommend play the fun levels  then move on as they are too greedy for cash.,POSITIVE,0,0.938667119,18-Apr-24

I do go visit all my tanks once in a while just to say hi to my fish ð¤£ wish we can feed more than just 3 tanks is my ONLY complaint. the game within game is fantastic!

Fishdom,This game USED to be great! A recent update saw changes that take away from casual game it was when I started 2 yrs ago. It's very difficult to progress if you're not willing to spend a lot of money. I was spending $14 a month and actually was ok with that. Now that $14 isn't even close to what I would need to spend to have enjoyable game play. As of today..I'd say don't waste your time on this game.,POSITIVE,0,0.914990664,11-Apr-24
Fishdom,This game has become nothing but a cash grab. Recent updates include less gems per dollar  you can no longer exit a game before starting without using a life  and yellow boards are no longer easy and are more difficult than purple boards. I am very disappointed with this game after spending a lot of cash for extra gems. I would give 0 stars if I could.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999467552,12-Apr-24
Fishdom,Game is rigged since new update  algorithm changed  been playing this for a while now  but now gives you less moves and after always forces you to pay for power ups  bare in mind I've done this and after you buy power ups you end up using them all on one level  it's harder to pass levels no matter what rank or lever your at  scam people be aware  I'm uninstalling,NEGATIVE,1,0.99923408,12-Apr-24
Fishdom,Really hate the update. They removed the ability to restart the game and keep your boketers/bombs as long as you didn't make a move. If you do  it's considered a loss  and you lose your boosters now. Don't update if you can avoid it. This game is getting worse and worse. ðð®,NEGATIVE,1,0.999791682,14-Apr-24
Fishdom,The screen froze at the completion of level 8102. Had to get out and back in to resume playing causing me to lose the use of the combination bombs which I had free time on.

Fishdom,Love the game although I find a few of the levels too hard. Too easy to earn coins but which can only be used ti but stuff for the aquarium but too hard to earn precious stone which are way more useful.

Total Battle: Strategy Games,Iam very new to the game and it has been an interesting game so far. I think the game can do with a little more explanation of some areas at the beginning...most seems like trial and error. Have been trying to create a clan but they keep asking for roman letters. When you lose soldiers the time to revive is very long without a purchase. The game starts off exciting but as the levels increase it becomes very difficult to progress without a purchase.,NEGATIVE,1,0.950531304,28-Apr-24
Total Battle: Strategy Games,The game is fun and strategic. Without spending money you can't really advance quickly in the game  making you disadvantageous to those who do spend the big bucks. And they have better armies which can destroy yours quickly. It's a money making game and that's what it was de designed to do. It touches on the inner desire of any human being to be better  stronger and greater than others. And you do that by spending money in the game...,POSITIVE,0,0.998208046,27-Apr-24
Total Battle: Strategy Games,The game asks for too much gold or silver and is too expensive. the math game stops at a limit and you have to spend too much money to win the games. it's like a gamble. the game needs to be cost effective but fun and if a feature is available it needs to be limitless.

Total Battle: Strategy Games,This game was good and fun. I've even spent about 300 dollars on this game.... now I regret it. There are powerful players that use the hero Ayrin and they can attack you whenever they want - as often as they want and there is nothing you can do. Really makes things unfair.

I really appreciate that it holds your hand up to about level 10. I've never been able to get into these games before because they were too overwhelming  but it thoroughly teaches you how to play. I downloaded it for the game in the ad  which is available with lots of levels too.,POSITIVE,0,0.999291182,10-Apr-24
Total Battle: Strategy Games,Horrible game. spend a bunch of money  get attacked by random players when everyone is supposed to abide by ROE rules of engagement... then you reach out to support to explain why or how your in-game city could ne attacked. And there's no sympathy. oh you didn't have a shield up. YES I DID HAVE A SHIELD UP.

Total Battle: Strategy Games,Genuinely loved this game when first started. Now it's so glitchy  can't play  always cycling. Chats unavailable to me  purchases not going through  because it's cycling like trying to load. What's the point of playing if you buy a package  battle  then go and revive troops with purchased gold; not only does it take all my elixir  but uses a ton of gold to revive only to have troops reappear and need revived again.

Total Battle: Strategy Games,Game is advertised with a mathematical mechanic in which you need to choose the better of two options in order to increase your army size. That was fun and I wanted more of that  but after a few levels of that  try game totally changed to some type of city building  game  that continuously tells you where to click in order to upgrade things. Some of those things are based on timers and tell you to come back again tomorrow. I don't know how to return to playing the fun math battle game. Deleting,NEGATIVE,1,0.998437703,1-Apr-24
Total Battle: Strategy Games,Too expensive. I played for a couple of months and realiased I had thrown Â£1500 into the game to purchase in game items just to progress quickly. The prices for these in game purchases are exorbitant and not value for money - ie you dont get resources or enhancements that even remotely justify the prices. At the end of the day  its just a game and has no real world value so its ridiculous to pay anything at all for it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999736726,3-Apr-24
Total Battle: Strategy Games,Fun game  nice distraction. Understandable that they want to incentivise spending but the advantages of in-game purchases are way too high and makes the game completely uneven for non-paying players. Would happily deal with advertisements  for example  if it created a less uneven playing field. Also would like to see more from a design perspective. The events are repetitive and there doesn't seem to be much innovation when it comes to gameplay.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99884975,26-Feb-24
Total Battle: Strategy Games,I don't recommend install this game. First even if you already you have an account it will force you to create another and spend 30 minutes in the initial tutorial. This game is supposed to be free but if you don't pay  everything takes days or more to complete. First it looks easy and fast but after 40h you will have to pay for everything even each time to changing to another hero you already paid a lot to unblock.

Total Battle: Strategy Games,Ever since the latest forced update  the game freezes multiple times a day and after it synchronizes  80 to 90% of all my soldiers  resources  might  etc  etc just disappear into thin air. It has become impossible to keep up with what the game just simply takes away from me every time it synchronizes.

Total Battle: Strategy Games,Game idea is great but the lags are terrible  especially when important events start. The servers are overloaded and game becomes unresponsive. The worst is customer service and the way clients are treated. You will never be right even though you have lost your money due to the game not working properly.

Total Battle: Strategy Games,Game is nice once you get the hang of things. => Some bugs & improvements required => Everything starts to cost way too much real money  game has to be monetized but don't overdo every aspect of it. e. g. Shields  Portals  Teleports should be cheaper. => Pathetic march speeds  game is too slow and too time consuming. Even with research  speedups and everything.

Total Battle: Strategy Games,Unfortunately  I don't have any feedback right now. mainly because I just installed this app. i was taken beyond the developer imagination.i can't wait to go to war. Graphics on attacking are amassing. It looks like a 4X game since the combat team grows upon choosing adding and multiplying. It seems like it will be challenging because of the difficult barriers run into. The possibility of subtracting many men fails the system/ game. Let's find out!?.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996344507,8-Mar-24
Total Battle: Strategy Games,Not a bad game. However  I'm not a fan of pay to play. Sure  you can progress for free  but there's some things you have to spend money on. Two things currently I wish they would add. First  troop recall. Second  I played a game where you can invest your in-game gold and get X amount in return. You can  in turn  use said gold to buy shields  perks  etc Edit: I'm in a clan.

Total Battle: Strategy Games,Just downloaded the game again after a disappointing first time playing. After the peaceful dome goes down thats it. Too many players that are leveled up to compete with them. Downloaded the game again after a few days to give it another try.

Total Battle: Strategy Games,Crashes ALL the time. Developers need to fix the misuse of memory. Game uses anywhere from 850MB to 1.4GB of memory and basically overloads the cache of the device. Plays great for about five minutes or about six or seven activities  then crashes because actions in cache are persisting  and not being cleared. Don't know if this is happening on iOS as I'm Android. That said  game has potential if the bugs could be fixed. Until then it gets only one star,NEGATIVE,1,0.999648452,10-Mar-24
Total Battle: Strategy Games,Complex and well designed. Collaborative & fun. 6 months later edit: I stopped playing all other games  including one that was my favorite for 2 years and now seems boring.

Total Battle: Strategy Games,Update: The game is free to play  however  if you want to contend with larger players  you will need to spend some money. Once you get past the introduction  the game quickly becomes addictive. For many players  our largest critique of the game is it becomes impossible to  beat  the game without spending a large amount of money. The game has aggressive purchase  offers . The quality that keeps us playing the game is the interaction with other players  and becoming a team with your clan.,POSITIVE,0,0.988694489,12-Apr-24

Total Battle: Strategy Games,2024.04.22 Update. Totally rigged this game. You can tell from the bizarre spin. 12 spins and most you get useless XPs. Only by paying do you go ahead. A total TRAP. After reading the reply I assure you it is rubbish what the developer says.

You meet others  join clans  they help you. But by day 2 they already take away a key feature  which felt quite crucial. They expect to rope you in & get you to pay.

It's an on-going process of building up your avatar / character in strength  wealth  possessions  armor  gems  weapons and tools  and joining clans and learning how to play better with them. There are multiple daily tournaments to choose from where you fight other players and numerous different kinds on monsters to gain points silver  gold  and possessions.

Total Battle: Strategy Games,First  I am VERY critical of most new games and apps. Having said that  I ACTUALLY initially downloaded this just to see how much it sucked. Really. Thankfully  though  I was wrong. Fairly wrong. Now  it is by NO means perfect (i.e.  '5 stars')  but it IS worth downloadingâif for no other reasonâthen to be more social WITHOUT social media (like me). Like all most [games]  you CAN 'buy' wins  but it doesn't constantly  remind  you that you can. Try it for a while  I doubt you'll be disappointed.,NEGATIVE,1,0.958815336,29-Feb-24
Total Battle: Strategy Games,Pants....You cannot proceed in this game without making a real cash purchase. I played for about 1 week  doing all the tasks and gaining points & coins. I evolved through to the Iron Age  where I managed to unlock archery. Great. To build archery  you need to pay for roads with diamonds  of course by this stage you've used up the free diamonds. You get diamonds also by fighting on the world map but can't win without archers. It started off good but just another money grabbing scheme.,NEGATIVE,1,0.987070501,14-Apr-24

It's infuriating to keep playing as it's tough to climb ranks due to unfair teaming  if this keeps up  it would be deleted.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999463499,26-Apr-24
Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,This is unfair tho.. I played this game 5 yrs and it was nice back then no toxicity and just friendly game. Bub. But now.. damn.. and second about the storage.. those who has lower storage like me can't enjoy the game. My phone can't carry the game.. it crashes even the graphics and frame rate are low. I have a lot of skins and I spend a lot. That's my prob because I can't see the skins and can't enjoy it. And last the matchmaking  can u make the matchmaking fair and square... Ty,NEGATIVE,1,0.996390522,27-Apr-24
Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,Good game but what i don't like is that it randomly kick you out of the game i experience it in a middle of picking and the worse of all when you recconect is that it doesn't get you to the battle quickly but your stuck watching the ai and when you try to control it it just make the hero go on a straight line unable to be control i experience it in a match stuck there the whole game watching the god damn ai and my hero absolutely feeding instead of letting me play.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99077189,26-Apr-24
Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,why is the signal so unstable that every time you play it starts smoothly  but in the middle of the game  if you don't meet an enemy  it always lags  then the signal jumps up and down  then it's not really clear  even though the condition of your home WiFi is really smooth  what's the point  just playing ml  the lagging is very unclear  ml  disappointed? It took a long time for me to get lazy playing ml like this,NEGATIVE,1,0.999667168,20-Mar-24
Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,I have played this game on multiple devices but on my laptop I keep getting stuck? I can attack properly but can't move. Network is good and no laptop problems. Maybe it's the game? Although I do like the design  the colors and mechanics this one issue just really ruins the game. I did also saw it happen from YouTubers who play ml so maybe it's hackers? but it happened for 2 games now. I don't know if anyone else have actually experienced this but overall it's a fine game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.97801733,23-Mar-24
Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,Pointless menus inside of menus  inside of menus. So obnoxious and arbitrary. Classic MMR scales off of ranked. So  in short  unless you want casual games to become ranked games  don't play ranked. Ranked is really just a grind fest and doesn't become even slightly competitive for at least 50 hours or around mythic immortal. Every other rank is a snooze fest. It shouldn't be possible for a completely new player to hit mythic in a week. That just shows that their ranked system is broken.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999714911,22-Apr-24
Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,I used to enjoy playing Mobile Legends  but recently  the gaming experience has been frustrating due to the poor matchmaking system. My team and I keep losing matches consistently  which has greatly diminished my enjoyment of the game. It's disappointing that Mobile Legends doesn't seem to prioritize fair matchmaking  making the gameplay experience unbalanced and unfair. At this point  I no longer want to play the game. I would not recommend Mobile Legends to others until this issue is addressed,NEGATIVE,1,0.999734342,25-Apr-24
Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,Honestly I'd give 5 stars were it not for the impossibly long wait times in lobby waiting for a match  it literally takes forever! For a game with so many downloads you'd think it'ld be easier to find one. The game is only enjoyable if and when you can play which for me isn't too often. Maybe it's because of the region I'm in? Idk  but whatever the reason  it's greatly taking away from my personal experience. Is there anything I can do to fix this?,POSITIVE,0,0.969197989,25-Apr-24
Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,The gameplay experience in MLBB is often marred by lagging  even though the ping times aren't unusually high. This inconsistency affects the overall enjoyment and competitiveness of matches. Additionally  there are occasional bugs and optimization issues that need addressing.

Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,I wanna explain some experience of mine that I thought it's not fair  so I just in the middle of playing rank match  it's during a late game match  suddenly my connection is decrease significantly with no reasons  I've got my analog on my phone start controling my character into the enemy base  so I take the wise way to relog my game and I think it's will fix soon  but I upset the loading was so slow. It's even only 1% of decrease constantly. I think it is some of trick. Please Do Fix! THX.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999278605,30-Mar-24
Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,MLBB has genuine problems that make me want to quit. First  Matchmaking  like for 3-7 games in a row. yes  I'm not the best  but I shouldn't be actively hindered by my team for 7 matches. Second  if a teammate is afk/didn't pick a hero  it will automatically selected a lane that was already taken or was about to be taken by others  it's annoying and is a contributer to the first problem. Devs  please fix this  I want to continue playing but with these issues  I have no motivation to.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999133646,18-Apr-24
Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,Matchmaking is completely manipulated. Or you win overwhelmingly  or you lose overwhelmingly. Dev's want to keep you at a fixed level for only one reason: To extract $ from you only. So  no ranking up! Try to rank down for a change  Then it's impossible to lose 2. With thousends of battles under your belt  you still get grouped with newbies always. This never changed over the years and never will be. Don't waste your time on this game. Heavily manipulated by developer for 1 reason: $. Stay away!,NEGATIVE,1,0.998662591,21-Apr-24
Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,Experience so far has been good/bad. I am still learning how to play  but it is putting me in lobbies with people beyond my skill  and sometimes I get a lobby at my skill  so it wavers. I enjoy the game with many options of characters. You can find a play style that suits you to explore what else can improve gameplay. There are some things that have to be worked out with skills and abilities  balancing matches. Overall  it is awesome and fun  and the support team takes toxic behavior seriously.,POSITIVE,0,0.997113824,14-Mar-24
Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,I've downloaded and re-downloaded this game a total of five times  and each time the core gameplay loop is a stellar experience all around. There was one experience where a player was toxic  but that was during an earlier playthrough years before this review. I will say that since this game is by nature competitive there is  a bit  of a time requirement to master certain things  and BOY HOWDY resource downloads take up phone data  but honestly? Overall gameplat is solid. 9/10  will play again.,POSITIVE,0,0.998866916,5-Apr-24
Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,Hey montoon  do you want to have a 1 star review again? If not  then do fix all of the bugs  like for chou's ultimate skill where it casts its second phase automatically  it is so disturbing. Second is that the network connection of the wifi is just stable but when you're playing in-game  it suddenly starts to lose internet connection that is only in the game but when I tried opening other apps like Facebook  the internet connection is okay and stable.

Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,It's a fun game. It can run on most phones pretty well with maybe a little bit of lagging. You can grind in the game for a while without getting bored (up to 1-2 hours.) Plus  it doesn't take much data to play (except downloading the game file ofc.) Overall  it wasn't as overrated i thought it was  i could easily understood why it's so famous at where i live(malaysia.),POSITIVE,0,0.958883941,17-Apr-24
Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,Uninstalling again 2024  no change in 5 years. Still the same problems.. and more. As of 2022: Game cares more for events  skins  those that take your money than the basics. Lag & stability  matchmaking  balance  cheats and hacks  bugs. As of now  game is stuck at loading screen. As of 5/2: Still terrible matchmaking. Bad lag. I dunno  little or not enough relevant improvements for the integrity of the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999789059,18-Apr-24
Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,I've been playing this game for over 4 years now I would've given it a 5 star buh the only problem I have with the is that is takes time to make matches most times.

I was playing recently and I experience some glitch in my joystick when I play  it's like I'm having a high ping but my internet is pretty fast. I even have a video of the problem. It resulted for me to lose matches because of this problem. I'm not gonna play this game for a while because of this.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998629808,18-Apr-24
Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,The game is very competitive. However  it is very difficult to climb the stars in ranked mode  because the team is sometimes unbalanced with the opponent. And every 5 star will definitely have an unbalanced opponent  while the team is not competitive in the game. Maybe there should be more balance between the two parties.

Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,Bruh fixed this kind of issue  I can't properly play the for almost a year because of the issue that is having. I can't play the game without using both WIFI and Data without getting lag. I play MLBB since 2019  I keep playing it using Data and it won't lag  and now when I use wifi without data it will lag and make my performance getting worse.

Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,Bro I literally experienced a losing streak because of the poor matchmaking it's not fair always having bad teammates and facing tough opponents most of my matches don't even last 12 minutes and I've lost a lot of stars but I guess that's just part of the game so I took a few days rest and came back but still nothing changed it's still the same and the worst problem about this game hope u guys fix it asap it's rlly annoying and waste of time.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999514818,27-Apr-24
Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,Using my main hero clint feels laggy compare to other heroes. The passive released sometimes get delayed  and it is so slow after using a skill. I understand that clint ult takes time to deploy that most of the time it get missed the target who is moving sidewayse.

Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,server is trash  there are times when it's just straight up high MS/Lag  even though all players are in the same server (it's like someone's using VPN). also  the matchmaking is unbearable  literally paired up with bunch of noobies and inexperienced players  whilst the enemy are experienced. My only problem here is the  matchmaking  and  the server .,NEGATIVE,1,0.999262154,12-Apr-24
Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,The match making is kinda unbalanced  and also the picking... Some players can be toxic when they're not switched to the roles they want (for example marksman  then teammates picking marksman again)...

A great game  it's just the players who's toxic ruins the fun.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998365581,13-Apr-24

Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,It's a thrill to play this game. But somehow every Classic matchup is not for somebody who want to try to have fun and try some heroes without getting mauled and mocked.

The carried  hides with others and gold minded player is always mvp and highest scorer instead of the one who have lots of kills for the team to be able to push is so stupid.

Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,Lol this game is trash now  I'd rate it 0 if I could. Years of play and tons of cash just so they can make it unplayable. Everything feels like fragile glass now. What a waste of my life time and money this game was. Cancelled subs. As a play for free  it's OK  but don't spend 1 cent. Skins not worth it and every hero you can buy with 'free' currency.

Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,Game would be 5stars if players HAVE to play the roles that are needed with the right champions. . Add a feature where we can ping if the enemy used their spells. A bigger Map would be nice with a objective revamp. Turtle and another team buff or team debuff objectives spawns. Minions wave should have more control technicality to them.

Township,Its a good game app  i enjoy it quite well. But the reason for deduction of 1 star is that it changes the level too quickly. Normally  in games  as we get to higher levels  the number of xp is also increased to level up. But here  it doesn't seem that way. I keep on leveling up so quickly that I'm unable to build my farm like i want to. Items get unlocked so quickly that i donot have enough coins to buy everything as soon as i level up.

Township,While a good strategy game  the advertising for this game is often misleading. Progress is slow. While it offers many options to unlock land  it is limited to one or two parcels a level (your choice).

Township,I like the game. It's like a farmville/Sim City. The match games are more my problem. I don't understand why grass doesn't appear after I make a match in a cleared area. Sometimes it does  sometimes it doesn't. Even using the powerups doesn't guarantee an area to get grass. I could make a match 6 times in a spot and never have grass occur.  then all of a sudden it'll happen after all my moves are gone. It makes completing some levels almost impossible.,NEGATIVE,1,0.993203878,26-Apr-24
Township,the game is fun but my issue is that you have to wait a very long time for the animal products and only just 1 after waiting a long time makes no sense. The minigame is becoming to hard with less or little moves until you buy more moves before you can leave the hard or superhard levels. Not fun and the game doesn't assist makes it difficult and not interesting pls do something about it. And then the power up the points required to get them is too much,NEGATIVE,1,0.999412417,28-Apr-24

I enjoy certain parts of thos game like the regatta and building my town. BUT I HATE THESE GLITCHES ALL THE TIME MESS,NEGATIVE,1,0.99626416,26-Apr-24
Township,Misleading  the game doesn't play as advertised. The bigger rewards for  available tasks  aren't awarded because they disappear off the list before you complete them but after you commit the resources to start them. Play it if you like microtransactions and timers  there was a fun minigame that looked like the ad I clicked  but I have literally gotten to play it once and it's not available anymore,NEGATIVE,1,0.999041021,29-Apr-24
Township,I really like the game.. And I am very addictive to this game. But I want to share some points which many already shared it and that can make this more interesting to the people who are playing it 1. The harvesting time should be reduced. 2. Undo option if you selected a wrong item production in factory. 3. Need to have more frequency to get filed reward  so that we can harvest more. Important point According to geographical location there should day and night time in the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.864763021,27-Apr-24
Township,I really like this game. It's really fun & creative. Few improvements that could be made 1) when making a new product  we should be able to cancel it if it's on the assembly line or move it to a later stage of the assembly. 2) Plants need to be grown way quicker. Waiting 10 hours for silk is silly 3) The candy crush game can be specifically difficult and because AI controls the game  I can be stuck on a level for weeks & I start getting bored. Removing the super hard levels  will be good,NEGATIVE,1,0.985712886,21-Apr-24
Township,Very limited growth early on. I've learned they push you to use your money to progress by making things overly difficult and resources very limited. Even the mini games get extremely unrealistic without spending money for the perks. Could have a load of potential if they cared about the players and not the dollar sign. Sad to see this. You'd think they'd know the better the game  the better the profit  honestly. It's simple. Un-installed...,NEGATIVE,1,0.999565423,25-Apr-24
Township,The game is really good  but lately when I start playing  it'll automatically take me to the yacht club and show me the previous regatta tournament. When I try to exit  the game glitches and removes itself. I can't even play the game anymore without this happening  so I've barely touched it in days. I am kindly asking for help in this situation  thank you very much.,NEGATIVE,1,0.990561545,28-Apr-24
Township,I've played Township on and off since it's early release years ago. I love how it's kept it's originality and added to it. The only thing is it's become a bit expensive and harder to get certain materials for land expansions and upgrades without having to put cash into it. Makes you have to grind a bit more  it's my only complain. As for the rest it's a good little game.,POSITIVE,0,0.997076273,19-Apr-24
Township,Interesting game. Keeps you engaged by introducing new things after every few levels. Cute graphics and meticulous detailing. Would recommend to a person who likes strategy games. Improvements: 1) The candy crush sub part is annoying. Remove that. 2) Should be able to cancel product being manufactured. 3) Should be able to change order of things in assembly line.,POSITIVE,0,0.746674418,22-Apr-24
Township,The main game minus all of the pointless subgame ads is overall good. However  assembly times need to be reduced tremendously. There is no way 1 cup of yogurt should take 1 hour and 30 minutes and so forth. It is programmed to get users to purchase money as it's difficult to get monetary rewards  mostly coins are awarded. Also  there needs to be an UNDO button  I've accidently used cash or put an item to be next in line for production in error with no way to reverse it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.982582688,24-Apr-24
Township,A creative game actually. Nice game for people who love designing a town. Cute graphics and designs. But i have issues with mini games & zoo its useless. I would love if they provide an undo option in construction and industries. Instead of zoo they can do an underground railway system which connects different parts of town with stops and all. I would love that. They should really consider about towns population interests like water  electricity & roads.,NEGATIVE,1,0.733131766,21-Apr-24
Township,This is a very predatory game. It's 'free to play' because they stand to make so much more money out of you by making the game overly difficult without spending ð°. There's constant pressure on you to expand. Which is made so much easier when you spend real money. And as for the matching game. Unless you're constantly using boosters  you'll win only when the game cheats in your favour. Some levels I've been stuck on for days needing only 1 more move to win...,NEGATIVE,1,0.996154726,23-Apr-24
Township,Great idea and the game is fun  but the only downside is that the algorithm when you play those littles games on the feria they give less movements so that way you can expend real money on the game. The other downside is you need to purchase coins and fake money to get really good benefits of the game. Im going yo delete is not fun anymore.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998311043,26-Apr-24
Township,Overall brilliant little game  fantastic graphics  unfortunately though everything on game is all money money money!!! Got rid of some great mini games!! so now there is only one mini game  which I personally dislike not enjoyable!!! Also Golden tickets are every 30 days  consecutively  Â£4.99 to purchase  no break or in house mini games. Nothing like it was  when I first played game  over 5 years ago!! Built and spent too much  to give it up  game developers getting to greedy!!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.988863587,26-Apr-24
Township,Game used to be really good  but having the same two events again and again is boring and makes me not want to play. Also when you are given the chance to win the $500 tcash  the jump in points is ridiculous. I mean it went from about 3 000 points to 30 000 points. That is impossible to do unless you use tcash  but then what is the point of trying. Please bring back old games like bubble gum rev and ride or something new.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999040544,25-Apr-24
Township,I like this game a lot. The mini games  the themed challenges  the graphics  everything is great. But something they added recently is really  really bugging me  to the point of madness... Every day  several times a day maybe 6 or 7  it asks me to turn on phone notifications. I don't want to do this. There seems to be no way to make it stop asking. And it's really interrupting my game experience. If the developers see this  PLEASE PLEASE get rid of this.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998420715,15-Apr-24
Township,The graphics quality and the way the game is structured is all good in its own. But the mini games which are more exciting are the hardest. Either be the match and merge or the matching tiles  they force you to use powerup and even then there is guarantee of success. Am fed up of doing this and really disappointed. You can't finish the levels within the given time frame unless you are a paid user buying boosts Am moving away from this one.,NEGATIVE,1,0.9964059,10-Apr-24
Township,Addicting. Stressful. Expensive. Annoying. The graphics are nice and the premise is fun  but I wish I could just play the game!! The sub-games that you have to play in order to play the actual one are annoying. I don't want to make helicopters and match shapes to break walls so that I can buy camping gear to build my town. Like...what?!? Can I just play the game?!? I know developers need to make money  too  but geeeez!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.996610582,15-Apr-24
Township,There are two parts to this game. First  the farm/town-building aspect  which is monotonous  but moderately enjoyable. Second  there is a match-3 game and adventure. This is your typical game which makes you look like a genius for several levels  with endless power-ups  followed by infuriating stretches where no power-ups are available  which attempt to provoke you to purchase boosters. Unfortunately  many of these levels require power-ups. Not worth your time.,NEGATIVE,1,0.606717885,7-Apr-24
Township,Please let me know how to fix this! To get the updated version of the game I had to delete it & reinstall. I've done this multiple times but it has reset everything. This has Never happened before I'm heavily frustrated as I am at level 83 and I've put in a LOT of time and effort to get where I am signing in almost every single day of a year. It is trying to force me to play from level 1 in entirety with no escape so I'm not currently aware if I can sign in with my Fb & get my original acc back.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996317148,22-Apr-24
Township,I'm thinking about completely quitting. I only log on about once a week now. The side games are just the same thing over & over. Only for more beautiful decorations to only sit in my storage. 1 to 2 land exp per update & that's not enough. Yet we continue to get factories  Comm bldgs & houses with nowhere to put them & actually decorate the town. I loved that I could decorate & rearrange but now everything is so cramped. Playrix needs to think about this. Bring back some of the old games too.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99921,22-Apr-24
Township,Listen the game is fun  there's lot to do and no ads. But some of these puzzle levels are stupid hard for no reason. I understand wanting a challenge but good god it shouldn't take a week or more to beat one of the  super hard  levels. I'm convinced the only way to beat these are to spend money on powers ups and I'm not about to drop a bunch of money. I've been stuck on level 370 and it's making progression in the event impossible  and it turn making the game not fun. Please fix this.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999661565,13-Mar-24
Township,I love this game. I do like all the features  they seem to upgrade it regularly  hold events etc. However  and I'm willing to upgrade my rating if they fixed it  I feel like some of the coin/town bucks rewards need to be better priced or more attainable. I feel like it's too central around having u spend money  which I understand  but there should be ways to progress without *having* to spend large amounts.,NEGATIVE,1,0.985982716,18-Mar-24
Township,it's slow progress if you don't spend real money. you need specific pieces to upgrade things  but the train brings you random pieces and never the one you're missing. you can upgrade by  you guessed it  spending real money. and the puzzle levels are almost impossible without spending real money to get extra turns. so you just keep trying until you get lucky enough for the pieces to align just right  so it's almost like they won for you. it's like playing with a handicap.,NEGATIVE,1,0.955057621,30-Mar-24
Township,Was fun. They have become so monotonous with the mini games and events. They took away the cute decorations for holidays. Now you have to pay and they aren't as good. The mini games used to have variety but now it's the same 2 rotated. I'm so tired of merge adventures and match 3 games. Bring back the sheep race and the airplane games!!! Bring back the mini game variety and stop with the month long adventures. It's so boring now that I've stopped playing.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998488784,17-Apr-24
Township,First of all  it's not like in the ads. Second  while yes  there are no ads in the gameplay  the way the game is designed is to really push you to use real money to keep the game engaging. For now I'm enjoying the game  but I just know this will end soon. Perhaps the developers can add a  watch ads for rewards  system  where you can CHOOSE to watch an ad to get a reward  instead of using real money.,NEGATIVE,1,0.797758698,23-Apr-24
Township,First off  this game is NOTHING like its advertisements  completely different. It's a pay game  I've invested $6 so far and I'm getting tired of it. They give you almost enough materials to complete the tasks they give you  then dangle the pay option for the quicker completion. You keep creating and shipping materials for almost nothing in return. Save your money and time  try a different game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999477446,25-Mar-24
Township,Super fun. Addicting. Be careful... However  I've been noticing my T-dollars are disappearing with no explanation. I'm not the only one. They're scamming T-dollars from us somehow  clearly trying to force us to use real money. I would give it 5/5  if not for this. It also takes FOREVER to get the tools needed to finish my constructions  so there's a lot of standstill  little progress. It's really kinda messed up  but it's just a game. The waiting makes me put it down lol. Still fun.,NEGATIVE,1,0.943839312,30-Mar-24
Township,Loved the game initially  but to have 5 super hard levels in a row is a bit ridiculous & frustrating. Not to mention the little spinners never actually destroy a spot that needs it. They always go to a spot that's already been destroyed or covered in grass. Getting a little frustrated with it and makes it not fun to play at all.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999620557,22-Apr-24
Township,Have been playing this game several years now and it use to be about the only game I played . Then I lost the coop I was in and my game itself. I started again. It doesn't move the way I direct it to move on the side games. That makes me lose the game play and it sometimes does not give me the supplies or products I have made for customers and I have to redo the product. I loved playing this game but it's got issues now and I quit playing as much. Pretty disappointing to see my work gone,NEGATIVE,1,0.999763191,24-Apr-24
Township,I love this game  I play it every day. There are NO ADS AT ALL not one single ad. It takes time (3-ish days) to level up once you get going  but it is a super straightforward game and there is no way to fail  even if you leave the game for a year or whatever. It has great graphics and is a well working game. I would highly recommend it for anyone who is looking for a game to just fill in time and it takes no brain power. Some items take a very long to time to produce  but its not a big deal. :),POSITIVE,0,0.998492599,11-Mar-24
Township,This game is unfortunately predatory. The main game slows progress wby requiring specific resources that are both random and locked behind significant timers; and the match-3 supporting game has multiple levels that are practically impossible without paying for power-ups. I wish I could like it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999527097,22-Apr-24
Township,fun game! just a few things that need improvement: 1) I don't want to be spending so much real money for township cash. I understand there are other ways of earning  but it's not enough. 2) sizing needs to be improved. some things are disproportionate  and I can't place things where I want them! 3) merging mini game sucks. there should be more/different games. 4) zoo tasks should be different. so much potential for mini games there. 5) STOP MAKING THE GAME A CASH GRAB!!!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999271452,2-Apr-24
Township,They are aware of glitches that delete your mini event game progress but continue to put those types of mini events in every couple of weeks. Seems to be an intended and purposeful disadvantage to players so they are not able to complete them and coax them into spending money. They are happening more frequently. Very annoying. And very annoying that messages to support do not help.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999655724,14-Apr-24
Township,Can you please make it possible to undo moves or decisions....such as changing what you have in the queue to build. Also for example it's very easy to click on things you don't want....perhaps a ploy of yours to get people to pay money!!! For example I accidently clicked the house I was building and it took all the dollars I had built up over time to quick build. I was very annoyed.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999326348,14-Mar-24
Township,The super hard levels randomizer is so difficult you can get stuck on levels for hours before you pass it. This really takes the fun out of the game when a streak is lost and all available power ups are used and the level still can not be passed. I even complained to support and there reply was we will look into it. It really sucks when you pay for the pass and the money spent is wasted because levels can not be passed to obtain the rewards.,NEGATIVE,1,0.982622743,3-Apr-24
Township,Updated 2024: super buggy updates and constant pay to play events! It's become much more expensive to play. From 2019: fun game  but you have to buy in-game cash to play in a co-op to compete in regattas. support sucks  response is slow and uncaring  but so long as everything is working and you don't mind spending a little money  you'll have a good time. cheaper to pay to play than many other games out there.,NEGATIVE,1,0.98485285,13-Apr-24
Township,It's a fun game in theory  but once you get to level 10 it becomes a pay-to-play game. The 3-match mini games are near impossible to beat unless you use power ups. Lots of bugs during the mini games. Double helicopter powerup doesn't do anything  powerups won't appear when you make the appropriate match  and the A.I. it's always against you.,POSITIVE,0,0.592761278,9-Apr-24
Township,Fun at first  but you have to spend real money to progress. So many times  trying to build something to grow my town but I don't get the materials needed. One item missing  but you can buy it with Township cash!! Only problem with that is  you get small amounts of Township cash unless you buy it with real money. If there was a version that valued learning the game and balancing the supply and demand with skills instead of in game purchases  I would play it. Goodbye town Fruitcan!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.997493744,23-Mar-24
Township,The play experience out beats most app games I've played. So many are more complicated. The only two things I don't like is when the light flashes on the matching game. It temporarily blinds me and I have to refocus. I can't imagine what it does to people who have epilepsy. They probably can't play. Plus  I don't get support replies and the bot closes out my questions too fast. It isn't fair.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999086499,19-Apr-24
Township,A good game but unplayable without spending ð° big amounts of money. You earn lots of gold coins  but you need cash for everything. Or you spending hours for buildings to finish or trains to arrive. I gave up because it's becoming boring and expensive. Save your money. I rather just pay a one-time fee for a game and not going to spend 80 pounds a month. Just to play a game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99153167,13-Mar-24
Township,Not too exciting  very calming with little side activities. My only problem is when something new pops up  you are forced to participate. There isn't an option to skip and come back later  not even closing and opening the game. I would like the option to choose whether or not to start an event  please. Especially when my wifi cuts in and out and all I could do is go through the event until I'm free then the wifi cuts out and I have to wait mins to hrs to check on my town.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998539567,10-Apr-24
Township,I really love this game but the problem I have is that before  this game used to have unique mini games which were fun  like the plane one  the rollercostar one  the ski-ing one  the ball drop one etc.. but now there are only two mini games which are the merging one and the colour matching one.. All the other mini games are removed.. this makes the mini games feel repetitive and not joyful. I kindly request you to bring back those mini games aswell! Thanks!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.997977078,17-Apr-24
Township,They try to hook you in and very quickly turn it into a pay to win game. Not just a 99 cent here and there  like dollars that probably won't even help you much  an illusion. They throw so much at you  and it takes incredible time to upgrade. Within a couple of days  you WILL be at a crawl at best unless you pay a chunky price for what you'd be spending it on to complete a single task. You never get the materials needed unless you get extremely lucky or pay. The reviews don't lie. Uninstalling.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99293375,27-Mar-24
Township,Not as fun as it used to be. Instead of new enclosures and decorative buildings  it is obsessed with this merge game thing  and forces you to play it for ages in order to get a single decoration... Just let me buy it with coins like every other special decoration for limited time  I don't want to play that merge game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998555362,21-Apr-24
Township,I love this game  my daughters love it too. The point is to develop your town  through farming and creating infrastructures such as buildings and roads... Very addictive but doesnt eat up your days since there is a waiting component inherent to getting it all done. Not too long though  just enough to make things interesting but still enjoy life IRL. Highly recommand !,POSITIVE,0,0.997464299,20-Apr-24
Township,I changed my rating from 3 to 1 because of the glitches! I love this township game and have played it regiously every day! But now  when I try to do any in-app purchases  I am forced to uninstall and re-install game before purchases will go through. EVERY SINGLE TIME I want to do an in-app purchase! It's very frustrating ð and getting tired of this glitch! If this continues to be a problem  I might have to uninstall app permanently! I really like this game...,NEGATIVE,1,0.994209051,24-Apr-24
Township,This game is getting so boring with back to back regattas and the same mini games. What happened to Township? Plus! Apparently there was a new update about a week ago and it doesn't show up on my phone or tablet! I've been playing for almost 5 years and can't believe the decline in this game. We keep getting  rewarded  with these GIANT decorations but have NO PLACE to place them!! We need many more expansions in our town and zoo!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999674082,19-Mar-24
Township,Not a bad game  the mini games are a little annoying and takes away from the actual 'township' part. Also a little glitchy  I have about 3-4 properties not displaying with a loading wheel which is frustrating because I can't see which building it is/if anything is ready. 3/5 but needs to be able to load properly and perhaps reconsider the mini game aspect.,NEGATIVE,1,0.991393864,18-Apr-24
Township,Was a fun game. You have to pay every 15 days to play now. The Golden ticket wins are just awerfully bad. It so hard to complete an event without spending. It now getting to be a money game. Daily rewards change and the cost at the market has went up etc. It was a relaxing and fun. I have a mental health problem so this was my go to game for a zone out from the world. Am only playing to help my team now but I dislike it now. So am stopping now.,NEGATIVE,1,0.981760561,1-Apr-24
Township,Yeah it's fun  but too hard to get T-cash. Too hard to get building supplies. I've been waiting for a frickin saw for days and days just so I can develop more land. Everyone doesn't have real cash to buy supplies  speed up train deliveries  get boosters for mini games etc. But  we play and support this game. So it's fun but so frustrating at the same time. It's discouraging to get a community building but know you won't have supplies to build it for weeks.,POSITIVE,0,0.88295877,31-Mar-24
Township,Overall I love this game. I saw reviews that complain that you have to pay $ to pass certain mini game levels. Well you don't HAVE to pay $. You can stop playing and come back in a few hours/next day and it's usually easier to win. Lots of folks wanting instant gratification these days! Hate the merge game!! Love the adventure game! Zoo expansions disappear  yet keep my coins. Pay for a building  then have to pay again for tools. Taxes in real life are bad enough  shouldn't have to pay twice.,POSITIVE,0,0.961075723,18-Mar-24
Township,I enjoy playing this game in general  however all of these earn rewards games Money Cash app in particular that have you play to earn rewards needs to uphold whatever they say they will reward when you earn it. I have met goals both with levels and in app purchases and do not credited for either  or when I get close to a goal they have changed it. Very disappointing.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999187887,27-Apr-24
Township,Been playing on and off 7+ years. Getting greedier. Rigged pay to win events. High ranking cheaters rampant. I occasionally spent money in game  but no more. I wish they had optional ads in the offers section. I've invested a lot into my town  and still like the game even tho its overcrowded. It's still Charming somehow. I would appreciate if holidays weren't forced &there was more landscaping. PLEASE allow us to turn off the intrusive in game prompts for everything. Very annoying.,POSITIVE,0,0.988600433,10-Apr-24
Township,Mini Game Glitches The game within the game to get goods made has been glitching since I first downloaded the game. The game is fun but then it bugs out and you just get stuck not being able to do anything but wait for the timers to run out so it resets itself. The matching part within the game works.,NEGATIVE,1,0.979230821,21-Apr-24
Township,I love this game  but like other players  I'm not overly fond of the mini-games. The disco and craft games are pointless and boring. The block match game is fun  but super hard levels are ridiculously hard and you get stuck on them for ages. I love a challenge  but nobody likes something that's impossible to solve. The adventure mini-game is fun  but replenishing the energy bar takes hours and there's not enough time to explore fully. Spending cash on my town yes; on mini-games no way.,NEGATIVE,1,0.991864979,21-Mar-24
Township,What started as an interesting game has now turned into a pretty dull one. They have intentionally made storage very limited  unless you pay  which restricts all the farming and other activities as you can't really store items anywhere. Trains are the only means of getting raw material to extend your barn but it's so slow and tedious that you lose all interest waiting days for these to arrive.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999800861,19-Apr-24
Township,Love this game. Have been playing for well over a year. can be frustrating at times as things take so long to produce and the mini game levels are sometimes extremely difficult without boosters and extra moves. I make sure not to be drawn into spending real money to get ahead quicker. It would be useful to have a confirmation button in the mini games before spending Township cash on extra moves as I have sometimes unintentionally clicked on the extra moves button instead of closing and retry.,NEGATIVE,1,0.521520734,14-Mar-24
Township,I went through the last update I had a level 46 town. Now my progress is no where to be found when I log in to go play it told me I downloaded an earlier version of the game which makes no sense. I've tried uninstalling the game as your  bot  said and nothing was returned to the same. I don't want to start over. I've invested time and energy into the game along with money. If you can't return me to my progress I'll expect all my money returned!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999599278,17-Apr-24
Township,I enjoy playing this game! It is a great game for children and adults. I think it can be better for instance I realize the developers remove most of the mini games and some products take too long to make at the factories  it is also too difficult to earn cash or prizes in most of the mini games as well.,POSITIVE,0,0.981125116,13-Apr-24
Township,I saw the ads and downloaded it because the game has 4.7 Stars at the moment. It's a base building game  which is fine if you like that sort of thing. The whole game revolves around  tap here  to begin a timer for something to be made or built  and until you get to later levels  you're just waiting for 15 minutes or 1 hour timers. Again  if this is your thing  that's great. But it's very slow  you sort of just download it and forget about it once you log off. It's not EXACTLY what the ads show.,NEGATIVE,1,0.976901114,11-Apr-24
Township,Initially I liked this game. But  after building up my town  I found that it started to take forever to get anywhere with it. You have to wait for the game to provide you with the necessary items to build things. This was alright  except eventually it stopped giving me one specific item...which means I can't advance unless I spend money. Oh  and things in this game are super expensive to buy. Deleted the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998676836,12-Apr-24
Township,This is a good game. It has so much potential and has all kinds of elements. I've had a sound issue with one of the components. I've reached out to tech support and spoke with  Ian  and  Katerina.  I've sent YouTube videos of the game to show the issue. I've explained the issue 100 different ways to make it clear of what's happening and I get the same standard robotic response of uninstall the app and re-download. The issue is such a small easy fix but they ignore.,NEGATIVE,1,0.943467379,19-Mar-24
Township,I Agree!! I'm on something like level 1638 on the mini game ð id Rather the levels start over after each new thing! Because being dumb as I was I probably did spend a good 10$ to finish after I said I never would! These levels should be  hard challenge  Not impossible without spending money. So when I do actually do the mini game it's Only in ragetta after a new start and I get 30 mins of unlimited lives and in that time if I even pass one level I accomplished something!charge less Also,NEGATIVE,1,0.991730154,20-Mar-24
Township,I've been playing the game for a few months now. I'm hooked because it's fun designing your own town. Someone said that it would be good if you could make the the buildings rotate 360Â°. I honestly thought so too. And also redesign some of the factories so it could be blend into anywhere in the town. So far that's all the problem I encountered. Otherwise it's a fun game. I always look forward so seasonal events cause the decorations are so pretty.,POSITIVE,0,0.998245001,3-Apr-24
Township,I actually love this game  I've been playing it for a couple years now but today  something happened and it upset me. I'm in the regatta and my task is to send off 7 trains I just sent 3 trains off back to back and it's telling me that I've only sent 1 train off. I've checked to see if the game needs to be updated and it doesn't can someone take a look into that? Also  the prices on here are outrageous. I have so many new animals to put in my zoo and I can't because of the cost to build.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994469285,9-Apr-24
Township,I like the game  I really do but everything takes way too long to complete. Building materials are way overpriced and the train never brings what you need. $12 for ONE piece of material to upgrade and waiting so long for minimal rewards is ridiculous. If we send a train  we shouldn't have to wait 4 hrs for it to come back with material we've already waited a week to accumulate. The zoo building requirements being the same as the farm makes the process even longer. If you like waiting  play this.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999310493,12-Apr-24
Township,Honestly the game was going excellent. No ads. There's a way around everything and so much to do to kill time. But I will admit level 118 on the puzzle is a scam. Avoid this game. IT will make you pay money to pass that level. It's not even by the count of moves you have left. It's the small spaces that you run out of moves too fast  shuffle does nothing  and the other 3 slots are filling up with no moves. Uninstalled and I'm not paying any money to play a game. Been stuck here for 7 days now...,NEGATIVE,1,0.999468982,26-Mar-24
Township,I have played this game for a while now and have always enjoyed it  fun and entertaining. However  in the last couple of months  I have lost every animal exhibit I have bought (the last 4). It just disappears and I have to contact support to get it back. They fix it most of the time but it's annoying that it happens every time.,NEGATIVE,1,0.993195295,16-Apr-24
Township,Only play this game only if your rich. They make everything so hard to get and the only way you can get good items or win games is if you have alot of cash to buy the stuff that they are offering. Also when your playing the games you better have cash to get boosts or to get extra moves for high amount of cash and get just (5 extra moves) like why? Alot of my friends play this game with me and always argue over how limited options we have if we cannot invest your credit card into it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99887687,19-Apr-24
Township,The game is something to pass time with. I like playing it  except it's a huge money trap. It takes hours for some crops grow and materials to load. It may take you a day to complete one order unless you spend money for upgrades.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996123135,28-Apr-24
Township,This game is ruining my game experience in a different game. Of all the ads available to watch for bonuses  this is the only one that you're expected to watch for two full minutes and watch a follow-up mini game ad. I will start reporting the ads if the egregious length isn't addressed. And NO  I will not play this game after dealing with that. An ad like that is a key indicator that the game is a money pit.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999801576,25-Mar-24
Township,I was playing this game for years and suddenly everything deleted and my town replaced by a new one from the beginning after reaching level 106! Everything has gone  my progress  my town  my co-op  the mini games and regatta!! I tried everything to solve the problem but nothing happened. I sent lots of messages to the customer support but no one replied or helped at all! This is the worst experience I've ever had. I'll never play this game or any other one related to their company again.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999768674,10-Mar-24
Township,fun so far. easy and quick to get started. Updated 3 weeks into game. You MUST buy building materials to keep expanding and be able to give people what they ask for. I have played ALOT and am at level 39  but the town is still at factory level 34 since I dont have enough buildings. I produce lots of goods and fill rail cars and planes. I play events and the stupid merge game that you have to do. But they do not supply enough to proceed with expansion and buildings! It's a Pay to Play game!,NEGATIVE,1,0.994645357,15-Mar-24
Township,I'm getting ready to delete this game from my phone because of the constant glitches and failures to load. You can't expect people to want to play a game that operates in real time and has specific timed challenges  when they are becoming impossible to complete when your app won't even open. Its a cute little game and fun while it lasted but I'm honestly just tired of of having these issues and wasting my time. They're nothing new  it's been like this for months.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998125851,13-Apr-24
Township,My 2019 review saying the best minigames were the restaurant  flying  fishing & snowboarding games still stands  it's a pity you can incorporate them into the golden ticket style game instead of the rotation of the merge game and island. The annoying thing is the past few days  the pop up requesting I allow notifications! If I wanted to allow you to send notifications  I would have already done that in the 10+ times you have asked in 2 days. No I don't want to allow notifications so please stop!,NEGATIVE,1,0.986162305,13-Apr-24
Township,I wouldn't call this game fun. Instead I'd call it punishingly tedious. Its hard to focus on more than 1 goal/order at a time  despite always having at least 3 other potential goals/orders. Yet focusing on 1 thing takes hours. Hours basically spent staring at the clock without anything to break up the monotony. Honestly  this is the type of game I'd rather pay to buy once than be nickled & dimed to make the free game actually playable.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997879624,28-Mar-24
Township,What can I say about this addictive game? I love it! How can you change perfection! The details are wonderfully animated. And as time goes on  I find myself enjoying it more and more! There is so much to do on it that can be enjoyed for several hours or for little snippets of time. A great all round game. Yes  some things take a little more time to make than others. But isn't that part of the fun of it? I give this game 10 out of 10! Thank you for creating it! One very happy gamer!,POSITIVE,0,0.999861598,19-Apr-24
Township,This game is a big waste of time. Try to build a community center object  you must wait for over a day for the building to be complete. Winning dollars is almost impossible. This game forces you to spend your money to get game points  otherwise you can not complete tasks. To send a train out for materials you must wait for over an hour. Like I said - big waste of time with very little return. Do not waste your time!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999711573,18-Apr-24
Township,I love this game..but just one request. In colour blocks plz give moves as per the level complexity. Now i am on level 1820 and only 16 moves are provided but its not at all sufficient to pass the level and i find it unfair everytime. The blocks are also arranged in such way that it wont help.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995645702,20-Apr-24
Township,I love this game!! Downloaded a few days ago  I'm on level 20  and I haven't spent a penny. Yes  some of the developments take patience  but I don't mind that. If it was all instant I think it would be less fun and far less rewarding. I can't bo bothered with merge games so I don't do the side game  but this doesn't seem to be a problem in the slightest. Also... NO ADS!! Can't understand the negative reviews about this free game. Its ace!,NEGATIVE,1,0.995657206,3-Apr-24
Township,Two hours in and I'm already addicted! Keeps me occupied when I'm bored. The only thing I dislike is that it makes you want to spend money in more ways than you could imagine and when it makes you save up your township cash so that you HAVE to spend real cash to get all the township cash you have already earned unlocked. I would be able to do much more with my game if the in game cash was made available instead of being held until you spend your own money on the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.991713881,22-Apr-24
Township,I gave this game at first a 5 star  changing it to a 2 star  for the simple reason every time I want to collect my reward by the ship racing  it throws me completely out of the game  and I already rebooted my phone 3 times  so I can't play anymore untill this problem is fixed  before the problem started I really enjoyed every moment of the game  but now I really don't know,NEGATIVE,1,0.996802092,17-Apr-24
Township,I loved everything about the game until I played it on my laptop on the Google Play games beta app. Now after that  I can't get it back on my phone. Keeps telling me I need to update my game or I'll lose stuff. So I click the update button and there's no update available on the play store. Just an endless loop of hitting update and nothing happening. So sad I lost everything right after paying real money for an ongoing event. Ugh.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999165297,15-Apr-24
Township,I installed the game 5 years ago and absolutly loved it. I love the professor challenges then when new updates came huge changes. Developers threaten to better the game and take advice  its a scripted reply. trying rhe game again. Still no changes it seems to me that no changes unless it benefits developers $$$$$ wise...That is evident one gold tournament back2back. i wont get any acknowledgement if my concerns  never have. The lame arcade game ð¤ªððð,NEGATIVE,1,0.985103309,20-Apr-24
Township,Good overall game  well designed. No ads! But it's too much pay 2 win  and too much forced into playing these (I'm sorry) STUPID mini games with no barin if you wish to advance. If I wanted candy crush I would've downloaded it. This is BS.,NEGATIVE,1,0.993452311,23-Apr-24
Township,Whoa! What's a game this i love this but it takes so many time to reach a particular level but i like because it's a game for me a time pass. It give me a so happy.i reach a level 100 for second half year. But I reach a 148 level in township.it spend for 4 yrs. I love this game. But i don't like a candy crush in hard level please fix as a easy level.,POSITIVE,0,0.996767521,26-Apr-24
Township,UPDATE: a month later  and the same problem. Takes from 3-5 days before I can play again. Why does this happen!?? Grr. This happens periodically. Game says I have to download update  sends me Uninstall or play. No download option. I have Uninstaller  reinstalled  nope doesn't work. Love the game  hate this glitch,NEGATIVE,1,0.999624968,15-Apr-24
Township,Mini games are repetitive & boring with same colour match  jungle/mystery rescue & match tiles Why? What happened to roller coaster  sheep jump  bubblegum etc etc. I only play for regatta now for co-op loyalty  even then the regatta purchases are repeating. Fire your makers  they've either sold out or lack imagination. And the jump in cost of the community buildings just smacks of greed. I refuse to spend money so you just make it harder ? Just makes you the losers.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999699235,21-Apr-24
Township,Graphics of the game is nice and I've played it for awhile. However  seems to be having some glitch where the tmoney would dropped without me spending it. Happened a few times  each drop was about 10-20 tmoney,NEGATIVE,1,0.983510077,27-Apr-24
Township,Steals your in-game money. Does not give you a yes or no prompt and just takes your money in the farming fields section. I've lost about $100 in-game money due to this. HIGHLY frustrating and every other part of the game give u a prompt for 'purchases'. This needs to be fixed asap.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999760926,25-Apr-24
Township,If you spent money on this game it's time to sue them. The settings  confirm to spend township cash  DOES NOT WORK which is deliberate by the creators  especially since after you lose a level the spend button in placed in the same position as the play again button is on the next screen. Everything is designed to trick you into spending Tcash. Luckily I would never spend money on this trash  it's not even like the ad. Uninstalled  maybe I should spend money just to sue them ð¤,NEGATIVE,1,0.999371588,23-Apr-24
Township,Horrible customer service! The game is fun  but customer service is horrible. I had an issue with missing t-cash. I was placing a factory to be built  and went to move it  then all of a sudden the timer sped up  it built and I lost tons t-cash. I contacted support. First I got no response through the in app way  so I emailed through the website. Finally got a response and they said there was no issue and refused to replace the t-cash. I tried to make a complaint and they closed the conversation.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999509573,28-Mar-24
Township,Love the game! I wish there was a function to zoom out further though to get a better look at the town. Especially when it is expending it's good to have a better overview. Hope the developers can consider this :),POSITIVE,0,0.99753952,28-Apr-24
Township,This game used to be good. Please bring back some of the old mini games. These long story based mini games where you have to play the same candy crush rip off to earn more energy suck.

Township,Hello to your dear TownShip team  My mother and I have been installing and playing this game together for a long time  but today with the arrival of the new update for iOS and the lack of support for iOS under 13  my mother can no longer play on her iPhone 6  and we are very upset that my mother's efforts have been wasted. Without my mother  this game has become meaningless to me  and I don't want to play anymore. I wish there was still the possibility of playing for older versions...,NEGATIVE,1,0.999569714,22-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Love this game. However  some missions are impossible to complete without having to make purchases. Also  the pet challenge is super fun but once again  unless you purchase cookies to feed  it's hard to complete it in time before you lose it. One point I was almost done with level 8 out of 10  the time ran out and pushed my pet to the beginning of level 8. It's s frustrating esp cially how much it takes to get to that point!,NEGATIVE,1,0.985220671,23-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,This is very fun  easy to play  rather addictive.. I'm enjoying this a lot more than I thought I would! The art style is cute  the dice games are simple but keep you logging in for more. When you're out of dice it takes quite a while for them to replenish  so it also doesn't take over your life  you go do things and come back in a spare moment. I love that any ads I've watched to gain dice have been done through choice not forced. There are in app purchases  but it's not a pay to win.,POSITIVE,0,0.999082685,24-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,EDIT: I dropped a star because the game has been crashing WHILE I'm making a purchase. I lost items from a $3.99  $2 99 and a $1.99 purchase so I had to pay again because I needed the free items after it. Still love the game but I can't afford to keep losing money this way. Original review below. Excellent game! Having to push through 11 different things before getting to play is a tad annoying but it's worth it to when the game starts. I love it and even dropped a few bucks to keep playing ð,POSITIVE,0,0.976016402,24-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,This is a fun game. I would enjoy it more if I didn't constantly lose progress due to an error code almost everytime I restore a kingdom. I've cleared the cache  done everything the support team recommends. I've contacted them  sent several screen shots. Never any real progress. I do hope they find a way to improve the game because it does have potential.,POSITIVE,0,0.987713933,10-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Fell in love with this game  the animation style is adorable and the objectives and rewards are easy to obtain! The one problem I've been having recently is the game has been slow or glitching quite a lot lately. I've tried exiting the game and waiting a few min and I've even tried restarting and updating my phone and the software but still it's not working. Is there a bug that needs fixing? Really hope it gets sorted out,NEGATIVE,1,0.996852815,14-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,I downloaded this game for points on Fetch. There are soooo many pop ups  when you log in and when you run out of spins - I think I counted 10 at once. It's really off-putting and doesn't make me want to play because it takes forever closing the in game Ads just to start rolling. Overall  playing in general feels cumberson and slow. I will give 2 stars because the game is high reward so you don't run out of throws quickly and the total design is cute.,NEGATIVE,1,0.947052896,27-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Super cute animation and music. I love the different aspects to gameplay  especially the adorable stickers. The only thing I would want to change is how often the various offers pop up. Sometimes I only have a few minutes between classes  and half that time ends up spent closing adds. They're much more convenient on the sides. I'm far more likely to purchase extras if they're not intrusive. Thank you and I'm happy to keep playing!,POSITIVE,0,0.997666836,22-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Only downloaded for Mistplay credit. Game is super limiting with  events  changing every 6 hours  with the minimum amount of points required to actually get a reward being astronomically high. The  offers  are constantly pushed in your face and take forever to get through. The gameplay can be fun  but is bogged down by incessant and toxic minimums and payments.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997539759,23-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Love the game but the ads are getting ridiculous! It's ruining the game big time..Had a blast at first playing with my kids husband friends etc but now there's over 8 ads that pop up like non stop I can hardly at the game. When I'm able to play we have a blast it's adorable fun and exciting. I understand ads need to be there but it's so repetitive! I would give 5 â­ if it wasn't for so many so often Ads!!! Oh and I get the free rolls amd you have 30 min or so to claim all but then they disappear,NEGATIVE,1,0.987085998,26-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,I love this game but a few things I think should either be better or work on. First is it takes way too long to get more dice which makes you either spent a ton of money or not play as much. Second is when the game crashes it takes progress away and you lose. And if you do make a purchase its lost and you still pay for it. It's happened to me 3 different times and I can't find a support email or number to call so I just lost that money.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999725521,5-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,You spend more time closing pop-ups trying to sell you things than you do actually playing the game. Open the game? Pop-ups. Run out of dice? Pop-ups. Every single possible offer they're running  every single time. It's maddening. I'll deliberately not use my last roll to avoid setting it off. I don't want to open the game sometimes because I don't want to have to close like 10 things in a row. Their goal is to make me spend $$  but instead I want to uninstall the game!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999121964,22-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,I've been playing this game for months haven't had any trouble. now all of a sudden with the new update every time I open it it freezes on me  I get to roll a couple of rounds and it automatically closes on me it's making me lose progress and it's very frustrating. I love playing this game and have a great time playing  but if I can't even open the game and get in it long enough to enjoy what's the point will probably delete if not fixed soon please help,NEGATIVE,1,0.966533184,16-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,It is a very fun  cute game! Fairly non-committal  meaning you can just pop in now and then to re-up shields  etc. It's heavy with pop-ups(one after another  jeez) to make purchases when you run out of dice  etc. Otherwise  it is adorable and mildly competitive. Love it. note: the new pet side game is unrealistic to get to keep the pet unless you pay... ***Lately the game crashes EVERY TIME I play :(( Please fix!!!,POSITIVE,0,0.998202205,28-Apr-24

But two times since the last update  that I noticed  I was in the top 3 of a tournament and the next tournament started without awarding me for my progress. I have requested refunds for the past 72 hours  I would go further back if I could...im so disappointed this game was my escape and it screwed me just like everything else. I started having glitching since the update.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998901963,21-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,So this is just a clone of monopoly go with a few new gameplay elements. I wouldn't mind  except they took all of the annoying and predatory elements and turned it up to 11. Opening the app  using your very limited dice  will give you no less than 12 pop-ups. Spend $6 and you might get 30 minutes of gameplay  or just 1 minute with no progress. Watch a full ad  and it rewards a laughable 4 dice. I downloaded for the free cash ap and I'll surely uninstall after I reach level 21.,NEGATIVE,1,0.677348435,28-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Waited a few weeks and a couple dozen  kingdoms  before writing a review. I'm either playing for 20 seconds  20 minutes  or 2 hours each time depending on how the dice rolls go and I never know which one it will be! Sometimes I keep winning and play (for free) for a long time and most of the other times I do my hourly free rolls and get nothing and spent the whole time closing all of the pop ups. Pretty fun overall though.,POSITIVE,0,0.99429661,8-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Played the game for weeks before posting. Fun to play but takes forever to refill spins. Sometimes you can play for a while then other times you have to wait all day for your spins to regenerate. That's frustrating. Cute graphics. I have yet to earn a permanent pet  but not from a lack of trying. It's hard to get their food. Especially when you can't spin to earn anything because you're waiting all day.,NEGATIVE,1,0.982999921,19-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,very similar to monopoly online  but with very different mini games each day  it adds more challenges which makes it even more exciting !!! the only problem about this game  would be the constant pop ups every time the dice run out  there's just to many reminders of the choice of purchases I already know about. otherwise 5 thumbs ð,POSITIVE,0,0.958502412,24-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,The amount of pop-up tournaments and deals you have to exit out if in this game is RIDICULOUS. Opening the games it takes me a couple minutes before I can actually start rolling dice if new tournaments and deals have started. Not to mention the pop ups every time you run out of dice. AND the forced animation for every single treasure chest and card upgrade. It's tedious to play the game which is a shame because I'd really like it otherwise. You over complicated a decent idea.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999012709,23-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,I know apps and games have their issues as far as technical issues. But I'm finding myself having more issues with this game. As much as I love it and spend a lot of money playing it. I feel sometimes that this game loves to rip you off on the prizes that you win. I just One a treasure hunt that allowed me to use my coins to finish the map. But I was unable to claim my prize because it somehow could not connect. So when the game restarted is as if I never won. That's why I give it 1 star.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997697532,10-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,This game is crashing repeatedly. And it crashes right when I make a purchase and then whatever I paid for I do not get. All permissions are enabled but I cannot attach the screenshots to send customer service. Fix this and give me everything that I have been cheated on and I may change the review. Pretty annoying when you're in a tournament and a few hours to spare in this crashes and takes your money.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999621868,23-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Addictive game  but recently have lost my built up spins and trail moves. I did put in a support ticket a few days ago  but no resolution yet and I continue to lose accumulated items... very frustrated! Updating 4/7/24 - got an email today from Dice Dreams asking me to submit the same information I've already submitted.

Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,It's a fun game if you have the money to put into it to keep going  if you don't the down time while waiting for dice to build up is extremely long and almost not worth playing  from my experience after going thru $40 in 5 days I had to quit putting money and play regular and I check in twice a day and am able to play about a hour each time if that. They have contest but I learned if you don't buy dice you don't play enough to win much from them. Over all im contemplating quitting the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.972670972,28-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,I downloaded this game only because it earned me a lot of units on an app called mistplay  but it's really boring in general  and the main reason I hate it is because of the ads. I'm not sure if it's just broken but every 5 seconds like 5 ads asking to buy game-money for 0.99 comes up on the screen and once I finish closing all of them  they simply come back every time i touch my screen so i can play the game.

Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,I like this game  but there are many issues I can't seem to get resolved. I've contacted support numerous times and have yet to get a response back. I have not been able to receive my daily rewards even when they pop up in my notifications. I'm unable to upload screenshots for verification because the paperclip icon doesn't work. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the game to see if that works and nothing. I feel cheated and not sure how much longer I'll keep playing. It's frustrating!,NEGATIVE,1,0.99947685,9-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,This is a fun game. I like the playful graphics and sounds and that you can watch a video a couple times to get a couple extra dice when you run out before you have to wait an hour for more. I'm on a limited income  so I don't do in-app purchases. I don't mind choosing to watch an ad for continued play  I just hate them when you have to watch one after every single turn. This game doesn't do that. So play is enjoyable.,POSITIVE,0,0.999424815,7-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,I really loved this game at first until I quit getting new cards  enough dice to continue playing without having to buy them and it's almost impossible to win a tournament or get enough items to advance  pet food  puzzle pieces  etc. I deleted the game once already and reinstalled it and I'm just ready to delete it again.

Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,At first I didn't think I was going to like this game  but then I played it for a while and ended up liking it. Only thing is once you run out of your dice you have to wait to obtain more that's worth playing another round or two or three n so on. And then at some point in the game it cost way too much money or coins to build your projects that you need to build I can't get past a level now because it's taken too much coinage.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994023025,22-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,One of the best . Ultimately I play this game the most it's so fun and entertaining... The only thing that frustrates me is when it glitches and freezes and I lose whatever I was getting as a prize it does this when winning chests or anything it freezes and then I end up not receiving the gift when logging back in. Doesn't do it alot but when it does it def is frustrating.,NEGATIVE,1,0.816862941,20-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Game constantly shuts down in the middle of fights raid attacks  steals dice rolls trail spins etc can't get ahead as long as it does this because constantly using up dice then you got to make a purchase to try to win something  the trail bar hardly moves up I have never made it all the way which is very discouraging I will play a little longer then quit and if you happen to get compensated the event is over I really enjoy playing I don't have a lot of money to make purchases Ty.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999076366,21-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,I was really enjoying playing this game however it has started glitching really bad. Now it's even gotten to the point that anytime I attempt to open the game it freezes up on me or kicks me out almost immediately. Can't even get through the beginning prompts. I've done all updates  cleaned my cookies and cleaned the cache. About to just uninstall and forget about it. It's gotten rather annoying!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999674082,9-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Fun  but frustrating. Too many times there are zero rewards on side games. Like no new cards five times in a row so useless  same puzzle piece four out of five spins so no reward in the lightening spin puzzle game  or rolling the lowest two numbers on a path 11 of 12 times so don't move forward much. At one point I had over 1000 rolls and didn't advance from one chest to another on a path because the low number rolls. These don't seem random.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999462187,11-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Started out great! But then I had an issue with one of the games  Royal Puzzle. I completed the 2nd Puzzle and it wouldn't advance to the next Puzzle or allow me to claim reward. Just stuck on completed Puzzle. In the meantime  I continue to win Puzzle pieces I can't use!!! Currently I have over 500!! I've reached out to tech support with no response!! I only have 2 days left before this challenge ends  then I lost everything. . . Thanks for nothing! Not fun anymore!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999510884,20-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,I like playing this game. However  as the levels build up  it costs more to keep building. Makes sense. But offering the same cash reward  whether playing the first level or 100th level  doesn't make sense. You should offer higher reward amounts  the higher you go. I would play more if you did this. Now that I've gotten further in the game  I'm getting bored because it's taking so long to get the cash to build  so I just pop in once a day and play for a couple minutes but I would play more.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997105896,20-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,I really like this game  but I get frustrated by the feeling that I have to buy something almost every day (even if it's a small package)  just to be able to be competitive in the events. If you don't have at least 1000 spins available at any given time  there is no way to finish high enough to get any rewards. I do like the recent addition of  teams   and team rewards.,NEGATIVE,1,0.866990745,8-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Good way to waste time. The incessant reminders to buy more dice once you've run out are a bit much  seeing as how they run when you first open the game. Sometimes I only have enough roles to keep me busy for about 10 minutes; other times I'm able to win enough to keep me busy for hours. Overall  a decent game. But it can get expensive.,POSITIVE,0,0.786442876,19-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,I really love Dice Dreams  but the packages are becoming ridiculously high! There is literally no reason for anything to cost over $15 in a digital landscape. That type of money starts interfering with people being able to eat and pay their bills. I don't know why Dice Dreams is getting ridiculously expensive  but I'm ready to delete the game now. Also  I'm pretty high up in the game  and I have no issue spending money  but the prices are just ridiculous now.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999306202,6-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Addictive. You can progress without spending money. Get on a good tournament team. Two issues. the incessant pop-ups wanting you to spend money. Way to many- I get that this is how the game is supported  but I you could cut it in half. The second is the glitchiness of game. Many times the game doesn't give you the prizes you won. Contacting support is hit and miss and it takes days to get an answer. I am waiting on an answer from support for an issue that happened 48 hours ago. DO BETTER,NEGATIVE,1,0.995773613,18-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,It is one of the few games of this style I sincerely enjoy to the point that I made in-game purchases simply to support the development. The ONLY thing I would recommend is to cut back on showing the deals when the player runs out of dice. Yes  it is good to show us good deals such as the piggy bank. It is also an opportunity to give  limited  deals to players. HOWEVER  we don't need to see every deal that is active when we want to build or do something else to claim dice without spending money,POSITIVE,0,0.998143673,22-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,I was really enjoying this game  however it has stolen from me twice now. The first time I figured was a fluke  and it took support forever to even contact me about it. The second time was last night and I spent a lot more. As soon as the transaction was completed the app crashed. When I opened it  I did not receive the rewards I paid for. I contacted support and sent all the evidence and still haven't heard back. Really disappointed and cannot recommend without this being fixed.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99835372,15-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,This is an update....love the game but had to take away a few stars because with the last two updates the game has gotten glitchy  freezes up  kicks me off and I can not play for more than 5 min before it kicks me off and I have to restart game. I have deleted and re-download the app 4 times now and it changes nothing. Please fix the bugs I miss playing the game and I'm missing out on helping my team get chests.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998933613,16-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,I made an in app purchase and NEVER RECEIVED THE ITEMS. Once the purchase went through the game CRASHED and my items never produced. Talked with customer service and the representative told me I received them because it showed on their end. The purchase was only for $2.99! If I was trying to scam  I would do it on a higher priced bundle. Very disappointed in the way my complaint was handled.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999764979,19-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,The pop-up ads for dice  coins  etc. are annoying and happen too frequently. I can understand once when you first start the game but not multiple times a game play. Get rid of the automatic ads  and this game would be better. I wish it was easier to get the pet. It takes too long to feed it  and I shouldn't have to purchase cookies to feed the pet.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999514699,10-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Love the app. Except for right now. I have one chest left in Chunks quest and I am unable to open the event. I have closed and reopened game  that didn't work. Unistalled and reinstalled  that didn't work. I have probably 300 rolls so I can complete it. I click on the quest and it acts like it is going to open then takes me back home. Put in a ticket but no response. I just want to finish the quest. HELP PLEASE.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998846531,7-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Wow. Where to start. Most rolls are useless  with tiny coin amounts  if you're lucky. I finally won a tournament  and it didn't give me the prizes. I made the mistake of spending money  and didn't get all of what I purchased. And the  buy me  pop-ups are in between EVERY VIDEO you have to watch to get rolls. Not worth the effort at this point.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999719799,19-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Absolutely lovvved the game in the beginning!.. Buuuut  unfortunately started running slower and slower  and glitching more and more. Then it started taking FOREVERRRR to open  and right when it was like 99.9% FINALLY done loading and ready to play  it randomly  just completely shuts down and closes out the whole game. Bringing us to present day  where I have yet to be able to open the game and actually get to play it for weeks now.

Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Game is addictive af and as with most games once you reach a certain level you pretty much have to spend $ to advance at all. The support is where they lost me. My game glitched in the middle of an event (after spending too much $ ð¤¦ââï¸) and buttons disappeared from my screen. Did all the troubleshooting nothing worked.

Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Having played the game for around a year as a guest and spent a lot of money on additional things  I got a new device and decided to link it to my FB so my progress would be saved and I could access it on my new device. It just sent me all the way back to the beginning as if it was my first time using the game. It took 3 attempts at contacting support over 4 days to finally get a reply saying that's what happens and the thread was closed so I couldn't even continue the conversation.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999498248,9-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Do you like closing pop-ups? Do you like meaningless progression systems? Do you like all game mechanics to be rigged? Do you like competing against fake accounts that magically score points in tournaments? If you answered  Yes  to all of the above  this game is for you. If you want to play a better version of the same core game  I would suggest Monopoly Go!

Little tip give the peons a tummy tickle while they're standing waiting for something to happen  they will react  they are playful and cheeky. There's been a few added characters to keep up interest  as always great animation fun cute and a family all-rounder because it is definitely great for the little ones(kids/children) it's colourful  vibrant and charming. Also there is no need to spend money if you can't afford to. Entertainment 4free,POSITIVE,0,0.999873042,23-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,The game has the potential to get a 5 star â¨ rating from Me. But it's was too many glitches from receiving purchases to actually game shutting down in the middle of winning challenges and not receiving rewards from the challenges. I love the game and the concept of it but hate the mishaps and then trying to reach out to staff to reconcile the issues you're asked a 1000 and 1 questions and no resolution.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999277771,15-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,It's ok. But the game could be better with less problems and more dice you collect doing the trails and quests along the way and a better chance of getting cards for your albums instead of constant repeats over and over! Make this more fun for those that cannot afford to pay for everything just to try to get somewhere. Give people a chance and quit being so greedy.,POSITIVE,0,0.998068392,7-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Despite investing over 50 euros into the game and achieving second place in a recent competition  I have not received the rewards I rightfully earned. As a paying customer  this is an extremely frustrating and disheartening situation.

Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,If I could  I would give it 0 stars. I used to think this game was fun. You were able to get rewards fairly easily  & this game didn't scimp. But I was 2 tokens from 20K spins in grand prize. I bought a midpriced package. It gave me several K in spins and 5 tokens to play for pieces  which I turned into 15+.

Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Such an adorable game! Lots of fun! I love â¤ï¸ it!!! Edit: Since the most recent update  the game freezes. My dice are stuck in mid-air. Also  I can not play the treasure hunt. The screen is totally frozen. I have closed the game and reopened to find it will still freeze at the title screen. I'm losing all chances of progressing in the overall game. I absolutely loved this game until this update. I'd like to continue playing.  PLEASE FIX IT  Then I can give you your 5 stars back...,POSITIVE,0,0.568575025,2-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,The game is fun  but the  stop and go  aspect of it is frustrating. It's impossible to ever play the game for more than 5 minutes unless you dump money into it. And then getting hit with 5 or 6 consecutive money spending prompts every single time you run out of dice. I get it  the makers want to make money  but maybe just pull back on the countless prompts just a touch? I would be really nice if a person could just sit and play this game without being hounded for their money.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997389972,18-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Playing for a few months now and it is lots of fun but I downgraded to 4 stars because it has become very clear to me that it's not possible to successfully complete a trail  keep a pet  complete an event collection  without spending money. Second time I will lose a cute pet because I can't afford to spend the money to upgrade in the specific time limit. I have had successful completions only when I spent money.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998498917,31-Mar-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Getting sick and tired of paying money into this game  only for it to conveniently  crash  every single time I level up my pet  complete a trail  complete an album or something else. And then to have to reopen the app for all my progress to jump back 15 minutes. And the only way to make that progress back  is to pay more money. And when you stop paying into the game  you stop receiving anything.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999718964,5-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,The game can be fun but it has bugs. Every time I make a purchase it closes out the game and I don't get the full benefits of the purchase. And the customer service is useless! They take forever to get back to you and forever to fix problems!

Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,I have been playing for awhile now  love playing the game  however  the problem is trying to get the pet. When feeding the pet  the line moves entirely to slow. It seems like a waste of time to even try. Also  you have to spin so many times before you even start to see the line. I truly believe that there is some kind of cheating factor going on within the game  how  I don't know. But some things don't add up. How can a person have over 2000 paw prints  and still can't complete the level.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999724329,10-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,I am so fed up with this game really  having to keep going back and doing stuff over and over  ie having to complete a building for the third time now when I have already should have finished it. Nothing shows up when it should and have to constantly restart the game to get the missions to show up. All they can say is go to the FAQ  which doesn't do a darn thing at all when it's a constant thing and my Internet connection works just fine  as well cleaning cache.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994135261,5-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Excellent graphics. I believe it is important to due updates on games. Every update has something new and I like that in a game. BTW  just loved the graphics you had for the 4th of July. And that was the reason why I played  because of the graphics. Keep up the awesome work you do! âï¸ Can't stand off how much I love this game!!

Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Annoying pop ups. Constantly trying to make you spend more money. Want to play the game but having to close 6 or 7 pop ups after every couple of moves is making me want to quit. Editing to reduce score. Never known any other game with so many annoying pop ups. May play for about 5 minutes and half of that is closing pop ups.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999731481,26-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,The game has good potential with a fair bit of variety of what there is available to do. My 3 issues is that first  it takes waaay too long to level up once you're past about level 15 or so. The second is that anything for purchase  it is way too expensive and you get barely anything out of it  especially coupled with my first point. The third issue is that once you get below 10 rolls  you can watch an add. This only gives you 3 or 4 rolls!!! It should be at least 5-10 times that.,NEGATIVE,1,0.974203169,22-Feb-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,This game is very fun. I really like it. The only thing I hate is the pop ups that pop up either at the beginning when you open the app  or when you are low/out of dice. Those pop ups are what ruins the experience. I get it you want money  but to have the pop ups come up every time you run out of dice is just super annoying. I would enjoy it more if there were less pop ups.,NEGATIVE,1,0.968118787,22-Feb-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Fun but...I don't want to see around 10 pop up ads mainly for in app purchases every time I open the game. One or two would be fine but there's loads  it's tiresome. You have the red dots on the sides for each event to show there is something to read or do so they're is no need to bombard us with the pop ups as well. Offering a measly 10 rolls to 'share' completion of a kingdom is no incentive at all. On the plus side the music  graphics and general play are good.,NEGATIVE,1,0.984948337,12-Feb-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Been playing for a while now. I enjoy it  but it has wayyyyy too many buy options and other things you have to wade through to play the game! It's irritating and quite ridiculous! I don't need 12 opportunities to purchase packages! You can barely see the screen for all the  extra ways to purchase . If it wasn't such a fun game I would have deleted a while ago. I like the little guys who bounce and dance..and the different kingdoms. Graphics are great.,NEGATIVE,1,0.595517874,11-Feb-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Love the game! Better than Monopoly hands down! I love that you all respond back timely if issues arise! 2 things I don't like 1. I don't like the pop ups continually if u are low on dice. 2. When you are playing on the trail and u land on the fast forward option a 2nd time in a row  it doesnt do it. You should be given whatever u land on no matter how many times in a row. Keep up the good work! I'm a big fan! And I'm always buying offers to keep playing!,POSITIVE,0,0.998059332,6-Mar-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,The game is mildly entertaining and not a bad way to pass some time. It is nice to play a game without tons of ads  though the offers are slightly annoying and overpriced for what the game is. There really is no goal or skill to the game and the team aspect or rival aspect of the game is slightly useless. It's mostly just short-term time wasting and luck. Not worth spending any real money for in game stuff when there's no goal to the game to get ahead.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995094419,3-Mar-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Updated to clarify: it isn't the ads that are ruining the experience. Every time I run out of dice  there are like 3 or more pop ups about the 3.99 and 99c. Every. Single. Time. Ads are fine. It's just the constantly having to close popups The amount of times the  deals  pop up is ruining my experience honestly. It lags my phone out. Otherwise I love this game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.666762412,19-Feb-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,The game is fun. And the different game boards are super cute. But if you don't buy packages you won't get far in challenges. And anytime your close to running out of dice roles (10 to 0)  you have to continuously hit exit on all the  promotions  the game offers  over and over  again becomes so very frustrating. I'm really bummed because the game can be fun  even with the ads to win an extra dice but i do enjoy the simplicity of it. Just take away the pop up promotions. It's all over the game.,POSITIVE,0,0.894442081,18-Mar-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Love the game but there's definitely some complaints. First off with the pet  unless you spend your way through the game you have no chance in keeping or really even leveling up your pet. I've been trying like crazy and I can't even make it to level two let alone all the way to ten. That's ridiculous. Secondly  too many pop ups. Upon entering the game and running out of rolls  if I want to see the pop ups I'll click them myself to see the options  I don't need 10 different pop ups in my face.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998509586,28-Mar-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Love the game  love the little pets  and love it all! So addicted to it! In the  fight  game  I wish they had more options than coins or rolls. You have stickers to collect  lighting bolts  spins for the trails  and other things to play along the way. The stickers are very repetitive  and it seems like they don't give you much for them. In the most recent pet game  my pet was full  and I was rewarded more  food   but because I couldn't feed the pet in between receiving more food  I lost my pts.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998999059,2-Mar-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Fun and easy to use  was my first impression but after playing for a while I noticed there are glitches that cause  sorry something went wrong  messages and kick you out of the game. When you return to the game  you've lost your progress and points causing you to play the same level again. It is frustrating  especially after spending money in game for more rolls or upgrades.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998549044,26-Feb-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Got this game through Mistplay and I loved it at first. It helped me get a lot of points for MistPlay and it was adorable too. However  there are SO MANY  great deals  and  special offers  popping up constantly that it becomes enraging. I have to wait for the animations to play through before I can close it  and there are at least 5 of these every time it happens. Also  instead of fixing the issue  support claims it helps the game run smoothly!? LOL it slows gameplay and causes loading issues!,NEGATIVE,1,0.97842741,18-Mar-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Love this game!! Always has cute and fun little mini-adventures/ quests/ challenges that keep things interesting  and the graphics are great! Only issue I ever have is that there is some lagging at times and start-up of the app can be a bit slow; additionally  if I were to give any 'critique' of any kind: my Daily Rewards/Gifts within the game sometimes do not load at all for that day  and there is nowhere to open up the calendar to show when they will be ready again  or if you've missed a day!!,POSITIVE,0,0.984384537,11-Feb-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,I like the mechanics and stuff  but once you reach a certain level  things slow down drastically. You then have to rely on perfect timing of building and things to gain enough resources to continue progression. DO NOT spend money. It will be very tempting to helo speed up progress  BUT as soon as you do  they throttle the rewards from dice rolls  trails  etc. in what I can only assume is an attempt to get you to spend even more.

Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,I love this game  but I have one issue. Every single time the video mania is available to watch ads to get free rolls  it takes it away before the allotted time is expired. I lose out on so many free rolls and wish this issue could be resolved! I have notified support  but nothing has been done to help this issue or can not open the feedback in the game. Also  the trail challenges and to complete the album is almost impossible cause you run out of time to complete and can't always get free rolls,NEGATIVE,1,0.999409199,20-Mar-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Every time you use all your dice or complete a level  they pop up 5-7 ads to buy more stuff for the game. Overall  the game is fun & somewhat unique. However  if you want to play it continuously for a while  you'll need to buy options or wait an hour while your dice reload. The in app purchase notifications got so annoying  that I deleted the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995323718,5-Mar-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,It's fun  addicting & simple to play. Only grievance is how EVERY SINGLE in game ad pops up EVERY TIME you're low on any of the game  currency  used to play. I get you gotta make your money  but every single one  every single time  can have people going from annoyed to eventually uninstalling it. (Good example is the person who told me about the game. ð) But  yeah  other than that  game is cute & super fun. I really like it. I wish we could attack our friends more than a couple of times.

Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,The game bombards you with pop-ups and offers freebies but constantly pushes for payments for extra rewards. Progressing in the game requires these rewards  otherwise  you'll remain stuck at the same level. The 5 spins awarded every 50 minutes are worthless. While the game interface is impressive  its true intentions are solely focused on making a profit. It's best to avoid playing it unless you're willing to spend a lot of money.

Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Apparently the new puzzle game is making the game lock up so it can't be played. I've tried restarting the game 3 times when this happens and it doesn't help. The game locks when the pop up with the new puzzle game is announced. I will try a 4th time but if it locks again I'll give up. I have since tried a 4th time and it locked up again so I guess I won't be playing again until they fix the glitch. UPDATE: After about an hour and a half the glitch has been resolved.

Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,It's got some potential here that's being dragged down by excessive use of pop-up microtransactions ads from the app itself  that pop up every. single. time. you run out of rolls  or when you load up the game. Not only that but these ads lag between one another so sometimes you load up and have to wait ages to play  as ads you've seen already slowllly loads.

Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,I changed my 5 stars to 3. It seems like every time I spin a large number on the trails that it never seems to reflect that on the little guage  it barely moves on the right and it wont let you count how many more moves you need to get to the end. I understand that they want you to make purchases  but it seems like if you don't  then you don't seem to progress as much. UPDATE: I removed a star. You need to get rid of the  mucinex booger monster  trail. It's impossible to break thru the wall.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997582555,26-Mar-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,I have now played Dice dreams for a few years  first on an account on my old phone and then sadly lost all data and had to start again on this phone. After so long I feel I can give a fair review. The game itself is lots of fun  great challenges  trials  and genuinely an addictive cute game to play. The issue is to play for more than a second you need to spend a lot of money  you get very little rewards no matter how much you progress. Constant pop ups and little rewards makes an bad game,POSITIVE,0,0.966213346,13-Mar-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,This basically copies the Monopoly Go system  but makes it far far worse. It's so pay to win  it's not even funny. There are like 10 popups that you have to close to even start playing everytime you open the game. For the first 20 levels  the game makes you feel like the dice rolls are fair. And then it starts to very evidently skew the results to ensure you never reach your goal. It will make sure you will always be just one short of your reward goal to incentivize you to pay. Terrible.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999740422,9-Mar-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,As of the update a few days ago (03/24) it continually crashes in the ad pop-up part of the beginning of the game. LOVE THIS GAME! SO ADDICTIVE!!! My only real complaint so far is the update notification is way behind & continues to notify several days after I've done so each time. Otherwise- minimal ads.. great rewards  super fun gameplay!,POSITIVE,0,0.995722532,17-Mar-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,DELETED this game!! Too many crashes.. It's a cute game  easy to play  mind numbing and relaxing. Minor issue tho is the pop-ups  after almost every roll of the dice at least 10 pop-ups trying to get you buy packages or extra rolls. If they could eliminate those the game would get way more stars! So an update...don't know if it is my phone or a game issue  but my game keeps crashing since the latest update was done. Almost ready to DELETE this game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995161593,23-Mar-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,It's a good little brain break for school but  as others have said  the amount of popups that occur when entering the game or not having enough dice for the multiplier you were using is annoying at best. I understand that funding is important  that's cool but clicking out four *different* sales and events everytime the dice multiplier changed is a bit much. It's a cute game and a good way to keep yourself entertained for a bit of time.,POSITIVE,0,0.998852491,25-Feb-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,YES ITS ALL KINDS OF FUN!!!! Once you get to the higher levels it's too hard to keep playing. Not everyone has money to keep buying dice. 8 die per hour is nowhere near enough to keep playing. Every link on Facebook I've tried to get free dice have not worked. Other than that I love the game. The graphic are great  the the characters are way cute. You just need to start putting free dice links that actually work.,POSITIVE,0,0.973410249,11-Mar-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Update 3/24: Muchly improved but still glitchy  but a lot more fun! / Fun  cute and colorful just love the game! Wish it were easier to accumulate pets. Lastly  when you start to run out of rolls the offers along the edge continually and repeatedly pop up and I have accidentally hit them a few times and it's extremely irritating. Keep the fun rolling!,POSITIVE,0,0.978060186,6-Mar-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,I really enjoy playing this game. If we were able to trade  All  gold cards on certain days instead of one or two that we don't need...or allow us to purchase gold cards  this game would be perfect! Also  if you do make in-app purchases beware because not only will it become harder to naturally get what you need but the prices will increase & stay that way for a long time. I also don't like losing what we have fed our pet when we can't control what we win to feed them  that is wrong!,POSITIVE,0,0.944797456,27-Feb-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,So funny ð ð game  but it has some many issues regarding the attack section. Screen  it shows you the options but not the value of each one. It appears that once you choose one  if you like to switch to another one  you can't ðð. About this same scenario  if you choose a good  undamaged target  oh surprise  it has less value than a damaged one.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99919945,22-Mar-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Boring  repetitive  and so many pop-ups. The game mechanism is essentially just rolling some dice  and arbitrarily improving things (which have no bearing on anything  except getting you to the next level  where you do exactly the same thing again). There are so many pop-ups trying to get you to buy more rolls/coins. They pop up unexpectedly  and the 'buy' button is always in the same place as you would press to roll  so you accidentally click on buy. Will be uninstalling sharpish.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997172594,9-Mar-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,I actually love this game  but  it only gets 1 star because of the annoying pop-ups. Fair enough at first when you load up  but to then get them every single time you run out of dice throws is annoying  I mean  you can run out of dice more than once in one sitting. All the offers have a red circle next to them anyway  so if I choose  I can look at them. Reduce the pop ups and I would gladly give this game 5 stars. Also the  hold for auto throw  isn't fast enough,NEGATIVE,1,0.998075128,28-Feb-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Pretty enjoyable game. The one major drawback is that prompt to (for a fee) break the piggy bank. Incredibly annoying as you cannot make it go away. Update: I almost dropped a star due to having way too many issues with getting gifts and rewards. The other problem is that it can be a total money drain if you want to keep playing at any level.,NEGATIVE,1,0.987655997,14-Mar-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,The pop up ads suck b*lls. Makes me limit my play time cause they are annoying. I do not need the offer ads coming up every single time on game launch. . . or when I run out of dice. Maybe once a day would be nice...Since the offers are usually on the side screen overlapping game play  pretty sure peoole don't need the pop ups multiple times a day. Other than that.... Decent game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.970346451,4-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Okay I've gotten past the last issue with game. Now there are a couple other issues 1. The points are not adding correctly I've been on game for approximately 2 hours straight but I've been booted... Having to restart at least a dozen times...each time interrupting action in the game including not only loss of action but points associated with it. Game seaming to aquire a slower speed and glitches. Becoming not so fun when attempting to make money by playing and points not adding and game slowin,NEGATIVE,1,0.998995841,6-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,I like to play  but this has happened to me twice now... I play the tournament and would be in the top 10.. but when I log back in  there are no rewards that I get as the new tournament has started.. It's inconsistent as it does not always happen.. I have lost so many rolls like this.. Highly disappointed!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999554217,22-Apr-24
Dice Dreamsâ¢ï¸,Had this game a few years back and forgot about it until I saw it pop back up on my recommended games. Since then  it's quite hard to stay away from. It's quite addicting and fun to collect the items to get more rolls and coins. There are freebies and items to buy alongside but rarely need to with the amount won. Great game to spend some time on and build little kingdoms,POSITIVE,0,0.998704314,19-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,March 2024. I'm just now finally playing this. The helmet icons to let me know an upgrade is available  should be smaller. I end up tapping on one when trying to tap on a different one. And if we could zoom in a little more  that would help prevent from selecting the wrong building. Biggest issue: STOP asking 4-5 times in a row to pay for something! I'm uninstalling mostly because of that! I can't take it anymore! Berating me to pay for things as soon as I open the game! Done! ð ðð,NEGATIVE,1,0.996739089,5-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,It's an okay game  easy to learn  realistic animation. But there should be a way to opt out of club wars and not be attacked if you dont attack someone else. Also needs to be a bug report button. I have several times now paid simoleons to repair streets that only stay repaired while I play. If I leave the game for the day and come back I have to repair the street again as if I had not earlier. So I have to keep paying even though the street won't stay upgraded.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994374275,13-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,I love the game just that there are some things that I'm discourage . One of the reasons is the blue print. It should also be made as currency and not just in a limited time. We earned it and it deserves to stay as our hard-earned reward. What do you think? We designed buildings every challenges  we put effort to it and when you're busy with things  leave your simcity for a week  the next thing you know. It's already gone. So  instead of making me stress-free game. It's giving me stress.,POSITIVE,0,0.951809883,8-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,Fun to begin with  but becomes frustrating. It may work better if you play with others  but the game  like most mobile games  either relies on exorbitant financial payments to advance  or a lot of time wasting. I enjoyed making my modest city  but to expand areas requires rare tokens which appear  for the most part  randomly. I enjoyed it whilst it lasted  but the number of payment traps in the game are frustrating  and brought about a premature end to play.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999020576,8-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,The game is totally frustrating because there are continuous barriers to stop you progressing without paying  and you can pay a lot. Unfortunately it is also addictive as you spend time SLOWLY building your city. Either leave it alone  or be prepared to pay. It is starting to look old and basic and you sense that they're trying to squeez as much money as they can out of this before the end  eg trains? It is happening a lot recently that you watch an advert for a reward  and it doesn't give it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996236503,21-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,Good ð I started playing this a while ago and up to level 18 out of 30. My only issue is that it can be hard to navigate. Ads aren't forced onto you  which I like. You have the option to watch an advert to get a random reward every now and again. I don't like how everything seems to grind to a halt after level 15. I do have a question: Is there any way to allow roads and railway roads to intersect? Recommend for people wanting to build big cities! ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.987363279,17-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,I've been playing this for a year. The recent railway network upgrade has ruined the game for me. It's impossibly slow to get Rail coins and you can't upgrade or buy rail items without a ridiculous amount. There is no other way to get Rail items and I've reached the point that it is blocking my progression in the game. The solution  spend $50 real money to buy rail coin? No way! They constantly move the goal posts like this. Don't waste your time and energy.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999732435,17-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,Bug report: Level 5 buildings won't upgrade (no hard hats popping up) *For context I'm on level 16  100% happiness  all coverages on parks  landscape and services aswell as a few specializations (education and transportation in my case)* but whenever my residential plots are upgraded to level 5  the hard hat icons stop popping up for some reason.. I believe this is a bug that needs to be fixed! Nonetheless I enjoy the gameplay,POSITIVE,0,0.976486742,26-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,I've been playing for over a year. I've spent so much money on this and yet when I look at my progress  It's barely anywhere. Producing item issue: electric components take 7 hours to manufacture and the resale is hardly anything. So not worth it. When items are listed for sale  can't retrieve them back if you discover later you need them. I have unlocked 3 worlds but now find I can't unlock another as I'm not even to close. I need more population and by this time  each house needs are too much.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999774754,27-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,Game was superb  asset was good. The only problem was the loading time when accessing any features besides seeing the town itself. Game mechanic and assets are applausable s it is very nice and interesting for casual gameplay. But the loading time is too crazy (>4 secs per feature). For player that wants to get serious  the time waste waiting for loading time is unbearable. Uninstalling.,NEGATIVE,1,0.988601029,17-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,Good game with great graphics and addictive challenges and you do not need to pay to win! Bugs - PLEASE FIX THE FOLLOWING: 1. ALL TOYS are NOT on the picture club chat menu - FIX THIS!! 2. New sports and toys buildings are 3 to 4 times the cost of the other commercial buildings! Reduce the cost and gift all players the difference in sim coins. 3. Sale value of sports items are too low  please correct!!! 4. Have search function for trading at HQ!! 5. Increase limits of collecting speed ups!,POSITIVE,0,0.733611166,17-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,it's a nice little game but far too many ads  and unless you're willing to put in serious grind time  every 2 seconds is an opportunity to spend money. They must make some serious money out of the ads and cash spent. overall  it's a shame  as it's a good city builder  but for me  it's turned into a 2-5mins a day game as progress during the grind is limited.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999376714,1-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,I don't like in-app purchases. Sleezy way of making people buy things in order to speed up the game. Your forced to wait on things such as produced goods  money  and simoleans. And in order to get this stuff and quickly  you have to make real life purchases. I'm old-fashioned: make one time purchase for the game and that's it. And like the old Sim City  wait for the tax year to be over and collect taxes and use that tax money to build things. Other issues too but no more space here to describe.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999106586,10-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,They changed the resolution and now everything is super small  I can barely see anything in the game. I don't enjoy the game anymore  it made it unplayable. Support is useless  I informed them that the resolution is too high and everything is too small  they replied that it is normal that everything is too big and my phone is low end  the second reply said the opposite. I've been playing for 7+ years and no  I don't need glasses  my vision is good as I recently did a mandatory eye test.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999355495,13-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,Mass transit upgrade was poorly executed. Train tracks should be an additional road upgrade. Stations should be a 1x2 or 2x2 building at most  and not require a full layout change. Station radius should be larger. Building upgrades should not require stupid train items that you have to purchase. Return mayor's pass rewards to original quantities. This turns into more of a blatant cash grab every month. Whoever is making these decisions is ruining what was a fun game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999693751,7-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,It's a good game but really lacks quality of life upgrades. For example: There's no confirmation when buying something with in-game currency. Trains station which are a recent addition loose their slots when stashed unlike shops which don't. There are a bunch of process that could be automated like loading of passengers but it's not and we have to click 4-5 times more for the same result. The global market is rigged against the player. Some rare items are available more than the others  etc.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999125898,10-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,I love the game. I like how well and realistic it feels to be a mayor  giving you demanding tasks and responsibilities  the more higher the level gets  not to lie playing without actual money can be frustrating at times  especially the expansions. But it would have been more intriguing if it had other features like a press  or like the city news  having a vice mayor who will be there to advice  throw opinions and make suggestions  and also if i as the mayor I can see my mansion internal view.,POSITIVE,0,0.985086083,6-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,Not bad. I enjoy playing this game  although I feel it's just too expensive for sim cash  and for the sim coins. I do understand that I dont HAVE to purchase anything. That is  of course  by choice. However  the fact that I cant make any sort of real progress after a certain experience level is so painstakingly slow that most people would uninstall the game as opposed to spending the current going rates for virtual cash/coins. 4/5,NEGATIVE,1,0.998392045,26-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,It's a great game but I have suggestion! The prizes for the weekly plumbob challenge are wildly unfair. 7th to 50th get the same prize  which is crazy as the points difference within this range can be huge! 7th to 15th should get a better prize. Also there is a graphics bug when you start building forests across ajoining plots  some types  especially pine forests will lose at least half of their trees  making things look sparse. Same with the sakura roads  massive gaps in trees can appear.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99949646,8-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,It's one of the better city building games out there. Pretty good. But the systems are kinda glitchy. The buttons take a really long time to respond sometimes. You need to wait a few seconds to move from one screen to another. It can get frustrating. Also it's a heavily pay to win game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.910874665,27-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,Love the game. I enjoy the check mark when train station is available.Keep up the good work! Much Thanks. P.S. Since the new download my game froze or lagged a few times and had to reboot game. Hope to see a difference soon. Has its down sides also. I installed based on offline games as it advertised. I soon found out it wants you on line every 3 days or you can't play and a lot of other areas can't be entered unless online. I think you have a false statement on offline game.,POSITIVE,0,0.984306097,23-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,Fun at first then you begin to realise that it favours players who spend money. Some challenges are impossible without spending money and there isn't enough trading options for those not in a club. The items that are generated from speech bubbles are a joke and usually just give you what takes a few minutes to make yourself. The cost of certain items is ludicrous as is the rewards structure. Developers don't seem to care either as little to no feedback whatsoever.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998137236,26-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,This game was solid when I first started playing it. I really enjoyed the city design challenges and the city wars. But the game has been steadily declining. The billboards in the city are constantly shoveling advertisments down your throat. The items in the seasons are whack  the Neo items don't making any sense. Its just a cash grab now.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996366262,17-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,Since December 17  it's been crashing whenever I travel to Green Valley. I'm waiting for a solution because I've already done everything I could to solve it. Restarted my device  uninstalled and reinstalled the game  ran the game in another device with my account  ran the game on data internet  but nothing worked. I'm looking forward to an update to fix that.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999244452,14-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,I have been playing the game a while. I like it. I hate that it takes over 5 hrs for somethings in factories with no speed ups unless you spend cash. Houses/medical buildings should be placed in storage like when moving parks  schools  casinos from city to city. If not the police/fire stations and houses have to be destroyed. I want to be able to move them around. I don't want to bulldoze my buildings. This should be changed! Also I can't add friends. It says I have too many I have 8....,NEGATIVE,1,0.989457548,23-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,Tldr: good for long term play with low social Gameplay: a simulation but without terrible real-life aspects like debt and excessive crimes. Quite fun. Graphics: terrible. While ok on most devices  some that it can't detect the capability show ugly resolution instead. Devs should instead allow users to set the graphic level. Ads: after ads frenzy a few years back  they learn how to offer ads without engraving users  at least for now. Most ads are avoidable now and they actually give you rewards.,POSITIVE,0,0.976633608,16-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,I've been playing since 2018 and the only problem then was not liking other players. Now this game crashes all the time and the UI / HUD is getting more and more cluttered with nonsense. If I could  I would rate this a half a star or even a zero. Time to clear out all the add-ons and start over; back to the basics. I'm always restarting the app  clearing the cache  restarting my phone etc. nothing helps to prevent the crash.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999801099,21-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,Addictive fun game; after playing for years  but there are many hackers. War is fun  but competition in higher levels isn't fair. You will run through money and other items to compete against hackers who have unlimited supplies. I suppose this happens in all games  but there doesn't seem to be a protocol or algorithm in place to remove players  and then you just sit through losses. Wish  ea  had a better way to automatically remove members with high card levels and low game levels.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997140408,6-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,The game is rigged. What you need for quests like epic point won't show for hours. If you need to sell something to make room most often what you sell will be the next quest. I only went from 90 points to 94 points in the last 9 hours. And as soon as I finally got what I needed the items showed up again with in seconds in trade.. this is clearly made so you need to either be very high lvl or spend real money for any kind of progress. And sadly simcity still puts way to much energy on disaster.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998958826,16-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,Yesterday all of a sudden my city storage capacity reduced from 130 to 115  I have noticed reducing in the stats  whenever I continue to play in in the next day  after watching the full add  especially the adds from other game like some garden something  I do not receive any rewards from the factory. Or house plans. This game was so good but now it doesn't deserve to be on my phone. It has become one of the scammy app ever.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997907162,4-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,Horrible UI. Would it kill you to warn your players that you cannot retract items you put on the trade list?!! Not to mention paying 1 cash does not actually retract the item  but remove it completely  which is completely stupid! To add to this  the game server performs horribly. It is very slow to access the events.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999817669,14-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,Don't like new train transport system. My older cities can't use it because the area is already crowded with Parks and Landscape. Also unhappy that you have to spend big money on upgrading Sports and Toy Shops to include being able to produce the Table Tennis Table and the Gaming Console. I can no longer extend my Capital City and my three regions are also running out of area to which I can expand. Can spelling of words such as colour & honour include the 'u' instead of the American spelling,NEGATIVE,1,0.999305844,20-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,No less than 50 times have I watched one of the ads had it forward me to some other website or to Google Play and then have it kick me out of the game and not give me the reward for watching it. There's also an attached section that allows you to earn additional simcash that again does the same thing where it just doesn't credit you for the stuff that you have done  and ends up just getting you tons of spam calls and emails. Be careful.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998945773,19-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,Great game for mindless fun. Don't have to pay real cash if you don't want to. One issue I have is that it's very glitchy. I've had to uninstall and install about four times. The last time I had to delete my town because it brought back a town I have not played in two years. Now  it doesn't let me save my new town.,NEGATIVE,1,0.990816474,17-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,Game been going downhill last few years. Addition of season shops (Santa  toys  etc) floods the market with worthless items. Adding trains made it worse. The game has come from simple helpful enjoyment as distraction from real life to being obvious cash grabs! Thus making many unrealistic assignments tough to finish and frustrating.. Game is not as enjoyable as it was few years ago. Gone downhill being obviously cash grabs. So disappointing.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999694943,10-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,thinking about uninstalling! kicks you off when adds play  so you don't get a reward. kicks you off when you travel to other cities so you miss out on things needed for progress. Very frustrating and makes it impossible to enjoy the game!,NEGATIVE,1,0.992556274,8-Apr-24

Lost it's charm then  uninstal.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999025941,10-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,It's fun but the crafting takes forever. You should be able to at least watch videos to speed up the time. I'm not just gonna sit and stare at my screen for 10 minutes just to craft 1 thing when I need 15 things just to get anywhere....it honestly ruined the game for me and makes me not want to play it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999133289,16-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,Actual city design and gameplay are good. But it's a insane grindfest if you don't want to spend money to advance more quickly. Cost to have all the content would take a winning lottery ticket. It should be monetarily feasible to get most of the customization content with actual micro transactions. But instead they show ads on the billboards even if you've spent real money  they release good ways to farm coins and then nerf them  and charge $15 for a single specialization building.,NEGATIVE,1,0.990868926,21-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,Amazing game for relaxing or killing time  just one minor issue and that's the difficulty of rearranging the layout and building placement of your city  if it was a bit easier (maybe similar to the system in games such as clash of clans) other than that its a great game to kill time or relax after work,POSITIVE,0,0.998631656,1-Apr-24

SimCity BuildIt,There are many things in the game which requires some sort of upgrade one of them is Global Trade HQ.

SimCity BuildIt,I liked the game prior to the update where trains or mass transit was released. Now I play just to design and do not go ougmt of my way to do competitions.

SimCity BuildIt,i really like this game but i'm struggling to trade and certain other things because all of the icons for materials or products are white squares instead of the picture. other people are having this problem too and it's unfixable so i think its a bug. i can work around it to an extent but only so far,NEGATIVE,1,0.999093771,3-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,CLUB WAR IMPROVEMENTS! 1. War logs should have a time stamp. Why cant even add this important thing up until now? 2. Knocked down timer should NOT reset every full repair or recovery. Its annoying that its keeps resetting every damn time. Especially if the enemy is just sleeping. I just want to end the war immediately. 3. Instead there should be a depletable time of 6 hours. This means that if a club keeps getting knocked down they will consume this alotted time. If it reach zero they will lose.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999667883,8-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,Nobody likes to be slapped in the face. I feel that is what the game controller has done to me many times. Now that I have made several complaints to EA. it has become clearly obvious it is now playing  hard to get . You could almost call it  human  because it doesn't like to be slapped in the face and rebuked either. Update: I have moved on and put that behind me. Futher Update: stored items are still vanishing. If my job or my life depended on this game I would not be playing this game. ......,NEGATIVE,1,0.997880101,18-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,Not gonna lie. This is probably the best city building game out there. The rewards are great  the graphics are nice and runs super smoothly. But there are also some things that I don't like. I think the new seasons should give the old amount of buildings (I think there's 3 free Mayor's Pass buildings before Tokyo season if I'm not mistaken). They should also re-add the personal war chest  that would be really helpful.,POSITIVE,0,0.995076478,4-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,Could be a really great game but what makes it fall flat is the fact that every building and structure costs a ridiculous amount of Sims coins or cash  which makes it take FOREVER to progress because the amount you receive from taxes  leveling up  upgrading buildings isnt enough to afford the buildings to progress. Another frustration is the inconsistent combination of materials needed to upgrade the building. You can never have enough materials to progress. This game is a waste of time.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999788702,10-Feb-24
SimCity BuildIt,It's great with all the updates and different features including access to new buildings etc. Beware The worst part about this is the ads. Absolutely atrocious. It's moneygrab. What they want to charge you to get a few dollars or gold keys etc is insidious. Some of the commercials you choose to watch in exchange for speeding up construction or manufacturing  literally take over a minute and you have to click through 3or4 screens..the exit button too small  leads u to download page.lmao,NEGATIVE,1,0.996106207,2-Feb-24
SimCity BuildIt,The game is superb! The best city building game  I have ever found on play store and my life. Regular events but new  doesn't let us become bored  the club wars  epic tokes orders' requirements and mayor's contest's tasks keeps us busy too. It has very realistic features too. But there is a very weird thing  when 2 trains are running in 1 track they don't collide but rather cross each other like they are some ghosts. Second  I would like to have lights on train tracks too. Otherwise superb!ð,POSITIVE,0,0.99842912,18-Feb-24
SimCity BuildIt,I've been playing for YEARS. But these new updates have ruined the game experience for me. The item demands are TOO HIGH. This game used to be fun but now it's just a grind and feels like a job. The two new stores  their outrageous in-game prices and time/material requirements are too much. I'm not even going to mention the mass transit. It's pretty obvious that EA just wants us to watch more ads to refresh the upgrade materials  and to buy more to make revenue. But now it's just annoying.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999728858,9-Feb-24
SimCity BuildIt,EA was voted top 3 worst companies for pay to play and this games no exception so expect to shell out cash to enjoy. Its been around for several years now so hasnt got a large player base anymore. Good to play until level 40 then it becomes a grind with excessive materials needed for a profoundly minimal gain. Max lvl 99 so after so much effort it pretty much ends.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999434292,28-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,Update : This game is one of the best games around..been playing for more than 4 years now and still loving it.. so engaging !! Just a note for EA : You guys need to control the Hackers/Cheaters who pops up now and then when we are in war just to spoil the fun of the game. Put an end to this and this game will take the top slot in Gaming in this area.,POSITIVE,0,0.999745667,29-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,you should allow the refund you stuff if it is gold key or platinum key. This game should have trans overhead like Chicago overhead subway-like tracks over the street. this should also have bike lanes. over all this game is the best city building game out of all. It lets you customize your own city. My city has grown so much since I have started.,POSITIVE,0,0.99961406,23-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,Guilty pleasure. Playing games is so silly  but this is somehow cathartic. I like the challenge of growing the cities without purchasing any boosters. The new Railway addition is cool  it adds a new level of logistical co ordination to keep your cities growing.,POSITIVE,0,0.992602408,19-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,It's a great game. But I couldn't get new train wagons inspite of buying many cards and surpassed levels. And One more suggestions. If you could add a feature which shows the whole city as a video it would be splendid ... Pleaseeeee do it,POSITIVE,0,0.997667372,21-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,I will say it is a great game to play  it's really fun and challenging however. Allot of the assignments are overkill to complete with little rewards that almost seem not worth it. But that's just my opinion.,POSITIVE,0,0.961450577,24-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,I only rated a 3 star review but there are more important problems because of these buildings. There's another one   my residential homes cannot create zones even there's another residential zone. Since reaching the Level 6   these zones cannot be created even with more zones. Since the past   it's pretty normal for Simcity Builidt   but now this has disturbing bugs when reaching to level 6 ð¥ð¥ð¥ I delete this game this is so embarassing,NEGATIVE,1,0.99951303,24-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,DO NOT PLAY! I have played this game for years and have spent hundreds of dollars on it. This is the worst group of human beings ever to run a development team. The new updates and algorithms are specifically designed to intentionally harm players. The train setup is a joke. The seasonal stores have 0 value except to piss you off and create storage issues. And they cut the season pass simcash rewards by more then half. This game has went from super awesome and fun to 100% pay to play. Game is BS,NEGATIVE,1,0.999712169,17-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,This game is good...but when you collect a wood or metal i cant collect it  i have to wait for hours and check if i can collect it  their should be collect all button so it collects all..2nd its the best building game but there is so many bugs...you need to fix it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.950577974,20-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,Allot of the icons like for example nails  planks and so on are just white squares. Can't tell what I need with out tapping and reading it. Also all of the things on the bottom are also white squares other then that the games good so far. Passes the time for me,NEGATIVE,1,0.994391501,16-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,it's good overall. the graphics are nice  the buildings are cool and the other features are nice but there's just one thing that this game has that made me uninstall. it's the waiting time. quite boring to wait more than 3 hours to get supplies ready,NEGATIVE,1,0.931808949,27-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,A good game but the developers are obviously greedy and the prices are stupid for what you get. Be honest one person paying let's say Â£23.00 not very often for not much because it's a silly price to pay for nothing or maybe a few 100 paying a few quid because it it's more reasonable for all ages and Alot more people would be willing to pay it..... Think about it.........,NEGATIVE,1,0.998161733,21-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,Was having fun and planning to spend real money until nonsense things like monster attack  disaster  and club wars start happening. I just want to relax building city  not participating this nonsense. Now I have unneeded war items in my storage that I can't remove or sell to anyone unless I'm part of a club. Glad I didn't spend real money knowing this would happened. Another game by EA that disappoint. I don't care what anyone say  I hate this war thing.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999372303,28-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,I reduced my review by 1 star for the following reason. While the game itself is entertaining to play  TapJoy  the company that used in the game for rewards for playing other games  needs to get their act together. I'm constantly having to contact support to get my rewards and stay on them to get it right. Electronic Arts needs to get on them about this. TapJoy is sucking the  joy  out of this game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.958392024,26-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,You do not have to spend $$$ to play (but it speeds things along.) I've been playing this version for over five years and find it's still good. The members of the club really add to the value of game play. Be prepared to lose yourself for hours of entertainment as you tweak your cities to perfection as you see it. No script  no drama (unless you volunteer for a club war ) only your imagination limits you.,POSITIVE,0,0.998653054,17-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,Really enjoyed it up until unlocking the mountain slopes - became impossible to buy anything on the trade depot that wasn't snow related after that. Wish I could relock that part and enjoy the game again but have uninstalled instead.,NEGATIVE,1,0.976735413,28-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,Having a blast but suddenly can't play cause can't empty storage  can't upgrade storage either until I empty storage. But only way to do that is to craft something  but I can't empty my craft stations as my storage is full.... -_- unless I pay $8 for one lousey move defeating the enjoyment of growth...easy way out but only way out. Boy. Bye.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996130586,20-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,I enjoy the gameplay and the idea of and for the game is great. I believe this game still has great potential in its future and has done really well for what it is. Thank you for the many long road trips and grocery trips you have saved me from.,POSITIVE,0,0.999867201,4-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,Gone to the absolute dogs. Mass transit trains  completely pointless when your city and regions are already built. Do they expect us to rip them up and start again? No city or region expansion despite repeated requests from majority of players  over priced prizes  items that cost so much to produce they dwarf the selling price  obviously economics isn't EA's forte. And to top it all off  they decreased season prizes but not the price. Don't bother folks  waste of time. Money grab is EA's aim.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999743283,5-Mar-24
SimCity BuildIt,The game is great  love the style of the buildings but since yesterday I've been having a issue where after a few minutes of playing it starts to lag and my phone starts to heat up  forcing me to exit the game and leave it to cool down. Then for some reason my whole device becomes really slow and if try to open the game again it would freeze up just after the SimCity BuildIt Logo screen with the top view of my city and it would either close on it's own or my phone shuts down  then it's a repeat,NEGATIVE,1,0.999640703,24-Feb-24
SimCity BuildIt,How the world works is weird. A house can be next door to a clinic  but it's abandoned because there are no clinics?! Plus btw nuclear power stations don't produce pollution - what's that about? Also they seem to be modifying the mechanics in such a way that you end up having to buy coins or cash from them. Plus the waiting on production is crazy. I end up playing other games just to wait on production to finish in this game  meaning eventually I stop playing altogether. It's ok  but not great.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999003232,2-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,I see no reason why a mass transit or train station will have to stay in between buildings to provide full services. And railways messing up my city map. Please do something about the mass transit services. It's a No No please... it doesn't need to stay in city areas to provide services,POSITIVE,0,0.590430856,14-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,great from the beginning!!! I would love though  if the mayor features would come back for more interaction with trading goods and services. Ive been on this game for over 5yrs now   the satisfaction never gets old  it only intensifies!! 4/12/24 Back again for yet another rating!! Game's still super awesome im years in now and its a part of everyday routine. Some wierd stuff i dont like  mayors accessibility is gone  glitches and funny algorithms  overall still on board,POSITIVE,0,0.96394676,12-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,I dont why but the icons are getting bigger like money and tasks also the design challenge. it is annoying. And to fix it i have to uninstall and reinstall and the icons are the right size but it doesn't last for log before it is 2 size biger and have to do the same process. But the game is good,POSITIVE,0,0.993338764,13-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,It's a good and addictive game  but waiting for resources to update the building is too long. Please make it shorter. The price for buying a building is also ridiculously high. Please lower the waiting time and price of coins for the building.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997819901,3-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,overall a great game that takes time and efforts. It can be costy if u want fast development and this is a certain dropback. I never spent any money on it so my city grew slower but in the long run  this game can accomplish you when you are killing time.,POSITIVE,0,0.997579396,7-Apr-24
SimCity BuildIt,I enjoy the game but it seems to me like all you want to do is make tons and tons of money cuz every building you got to get you need SIM cash or whatever it is it's ridiculous. There should be a way to win the money for your schools and buildings like that that you need in the game not out of your pocket it's b******* That's what I truly think,NEGATIVE,1,0.770213783,7-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I really should have read the reviews before starting to play this game. DON'T PLAY! It is a very fun game  but after about level 30  it takes too long to create items and you rarely get to achieve all the daily tasks without paying for extra time. They just changed the game and added higher level items which makes it harder. Specialty items are so hard/take too long to get without buying them. Just seem money hungry when charge up packs are $10 or higher and doesn't give much.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998467028,23-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,It was somewhat enjoyable. But I am very upset  because I had to merge 100+ items to make one for a mission. When giving it to the person to complete the mission  it said Connection Lost! After reopening the game  the item is GONE but the mission is not completed. I merged for a long time and spent lightning bolts to get the items to merge  just to disappear into thin air! I will likely not be playing this game much longer. It turned out to be a major waste of time in this case.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999697685,17-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Liked this game at first  now each update seems to make it worse. Pretty much impossible to progress without spending insane amounts of money. Some of the icons have been changed to look like kids stickers. Some items evolutions have been extended to make it even harder to get auto orders. And to add to the issues  i had built up loads of energy only to load up and find it had dissapeared and reset to 100!! Fuming!! Whoever is in charge of this game needs a wake up call.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999696136,11-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I really like the game but when you work 2 jobs and just want to relax and see progress...don't set your sights on on quick accomplishments. At first the skills were obtainable  but each level requires more than 100 coins so there's a lot of lag time. My feelings are changing about it. I understand that challenges are part of the adventure  but the more you achieve...the more you should earn and the less time (which is valuable to me) you should have to wait. overall a good way to unwind,POSITIVE,0,0.987787426,16-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I really enjoy this game  but the latest update has decreased the coin value for some items. The daily challenges used to be something I enjoyed completing  but they have become so difficult  to the point of the impossible  to complete (without spending money). As the game processes  the orders become increasingly difficult as one would expect  yet the energy counter remains capped at 100. If higher levels equated to a higher energy cap  you'd have some very happy players :),NEGATIVE,1,0.983744323,20-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I love this game HOWEVER being level 65 and still only getting 100 max energy is impossible to beat the daily challenges without spending money. I think when you level up  especially being at a higher level  you should get more max energy. Also  the new update with the changes in the look of the items I am not a fan of. It looks a little too childish. If it ain't broke  don't fix it. I honestly may take a break for awhile because of the new look.,NEGATIVE,1,0.981820881,11-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,This was a fun  addictive game when I started it  but each update makes it worse. The new items are HIDEOUS? Why is everything so BRIGHT & garish? Takes forever to get items...I would literally play all day & watch the stupid ads if I had more energy  but it's gone in no time with nothing to show for it. Game needs a revamp. Editing to add that it just keeps getting worse. What is up with this sewing station?! It shouldn't take all day to move through one item.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999491572,16-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Ever since Moon space or whoever they are took over from magmatic the game has just gone downhill. Super glitchy  challenges are getting crazy challenging and the number of duplicate cards for the album is insane - I will never get it done. They are trying to force people to spend money. I was super addicted to this game but now I want to delete. I have not and will not spend money on something that should be enjoyed at leisure. I will see if the update sorts out the glitches otherwise I'm done,NEGATIVE,1,0.999678612,17-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I use to love this game...spent hundreds of dollars playing...however  when they update game  my top stickers out of the sticker collection went missing! The ones I worked so hard to get! Plus the artwork is horrible everytime they upgrade. When I write them to ask to replace my items  they do a scripted sorry you feel that way  etc and they do nothing about it! The game keeps glitching. I'm done spending money on this game and I've lost my motivation:(,NEGATIVE,1,0.999665141,18-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,At first  this game was a ton of fun and a nice way to pass the time. But after leveling up a bit  it's pretty much unplayable unless you shell out a good amount of money. It's impossible to finish the daily tasks. The card events would be better if you could trade golden cards. 99% of card packs I got from the daily challenges were duplicates. I get wanting / needing to make money  but making the game unplayable unless you pay a good chunk is just a scam.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998814702,25-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I really enjoy the game but just had an issue. I was playing  just spent around 50 gems (not sure exactly how many) to get two extra items from merges to fill an order. As the order was filling a load sign came on and went for minutes. I had to restart my phone and when I did the game reverted to a state minutes before the loading but my gems were still gone. Not happy with that.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999517679,26-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I used to LOVE this game. I never minded purchasing energy/jewels from to help me along. However  once I hit the pet part  I have LOATHED the game. They do not give you enough of either the cat or dog supplies (they're always just one off). It clutters up the board CONSTANTLY. It's no longer fun. The latest graphic updates are super ugly. They don't match well w/ the previous art that was sleek & well done. Also super unhappy the side game is now dependent on fulfilling orders in the main game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999741256,14-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,This is the first merge game that kept my attention more than five minutes. It actually involves a bit of strategy; you need to plan ahead. I love that you can skip the story or turn it completely off. Things I don't love; it's a resource pig. It leans towards inapp purchases if you want to progress quickly. Biggest peeve is you need Facebook to take advantage of many of the bonuses rather than just having a friends list (which you could easily do) and NOT EVERYONE HAS FACEBOOK!,NEGATIVE,1,0.990419805,14-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,PLEASE FIX SOMETHING OR I CANT KEEP PLAYING THIS! I've been playing this game for over a year now. LOVE IT even though I have major issues with certain things! Firstly: the most recent update made some of the icons look HORRIBLE childish and cartoon like in a cheap way. (the duck and dragon ride things for example) I don't know if these are just part of a seasonal change but please bring back the originals. Secondly: give us MORE energy  I cant keep spending this much ð¸  I will have to stop,NEGATIVE,1,0.992256522,17-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I absolutely love Travel Town I usually don't play the merge games but Travel Town is fun and I love the different daily challenges. I'm so glad I chose to play it I've been telling my friends and family about it as well I've even been sneaking to play it at work. I just wish I could use the coins to purchase items like energy though instead of the diamonds. Diamonds should be used to purchase more exclusive items like if you want to upgrade your maxed out producers. Still the game is great fun.,POSITIVE,0,0.999675512,20-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I've been playing for about 2 months. Last week when the update became available  my game will no longer load on my iPad. It's stuck on the Update Available screen. I have done everything to fix it  including emailing tech support. They have not gotten back to me since being sent all of my info. Over the weekend  I realized I could play on my Android phone. This morning  it started saying my connection was lost after I played for about 10 minutes. I have turned my phone off. I've lost money.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999680877,8-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Update: Update to art is ugly AF. Such a make under. Changes to the game contulinue to be a downgrade in user experience. | Went from fun and relaxing to ridiculous cash grab. I say this as someone who actually doesn't mind paying for in-app purchases. But when you have to spend a significant amount to meet the goals  it just isn't fun anymore. Not too mention the chest change. Can't even be strategic with energy. Everything is automatically collected.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999126017,11-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I started with high rating. But everything changed. The rewards has been decreased a lot. You can play a few minutes  than you finish energy and to get new you need to use diamonds  which also finish very fast. Than you have to buy more. I didn't mind to spend little amounts like in every game  but they asked more and more. Cannot spend so much. The result is that cannot complete any task  cannot finish the albums or other events  losing the funniest part. Now it is just boring. No motivation.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999322414,12-Feb-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,The game is very responsive and fun to play. There is no lag when merging and the graphics and colors are pleasing to look at. My biggest issue with this game  and the reason it's getting 2 stars is simply that there appears to be a disconnect between the developers and their customer base. The good packs for energy and gems are locked behind a pricey pay wall. $17.99 if I run out of energy is a huge amount to pay for a merge game and the rewards spend too fast to be worth it. I'd rather see ads,NEGATIVE,1,0.990356266,7-Feb-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Travel Town started as a fun matching game  then became challenging  then a waste of time. Minutes are wasted waiting for items to recharge. It then gives you 6-10 matching items before it recharges again. Over time more matching items are needed to complete your order. You end up more waiting than playing. Of course  you can use gems to speed process  but you'll be out of them quickly. Then it becomes a paying game. $$$ Power maximum is 100 and disappears quickly. Get rid of recharging. Thx,NEGATIVE,1,0.999248087,16-Mar-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Getting ridiculous! I completely fell in love with Travel Town when I first started playing about 6 months ago. Now  it's just stressful and frustrating with the constant high-level items that need so much energy. I don't mind paying for extra energy and used to but am not anymore because it is so frustrating. All of a sudden it takes 20 000 coins for a building upgrade? You just stop advancing. Loved the special games but same with those. Just not really fun anymore.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994295776,6-Feb-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Unfortunately  it's not like the ad. It's too busy looking  too many things on screen when filling orders for different item types. I have no clue why the interactive part is even there as it's basically talking to itself. You don't talk to others. Worst of all is the limited time b4 you must stop. Every few minutes energy runs out and you can't play. Really dumb. Not relaxing. The ad is false  but fun! I can play while I am getting points for other games. Uninstalling.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994389236,14-Mar-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,It's a fun game on the surface  but is the least giving when it comes to energy of any merge game I've played. Daily tasks are borderline extremely difficult if you're not setting timers for when your energy recharges or something. I'm lucky to complete one big item in a full day. It's an issue many merge games have and a few things have been added to combat that grind  but not nearly enough. It was fun for a few weeks or so.,POSITIVE,0,0.97288233,11-Mar-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Pretty fun freemium game. It has the standard formula  make things happen  which costs energy  run out of energy  wait for energy to refill  repeat. You can pay to top up your energy. I'm sure the higher will take FOREVER to get done. The game plays well and looks good. It's easy to play and get into the meat of it. Minus 2 stars for not having any music. No music in a time-killer game is a huge quality issue. Games like this always have good music.,POSITIVE,0,0.997663617,29-Mar-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,This game has potential. I play a lot of merge games and sadly it falls short of my expectations. It is wholly imbalanced. The coin rewards structure for merged items doesn't justify the energy usage. No achievement structure to offer additional rewards. The cost to upgrade buildings again is too heavy for how much energy is earned completing upgrades. It works out like a 95% spend and 5% energy reward  progression becomes stunted and then the game stalls which is frankly... Boring AF.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999657035,15-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I really enjoy this game  but unfortunately it's become impossible to complete challenges without spending money. Even if it were just really hard that would be one thing  but it's actually physically impossible to do it because you don't get enough energy within 24 hours to complete challenges - you have to buy more energy if you want to do it  or take several days to build up a store of items (and even that's not guaranteed to work). It's quite disappointing  really :(,NEGATIVE,1,0.9996382,16-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Travel Town is an enjoyable and challenging merge game. It is possible to play for free with zero ads if you choose. To reach higher levels spending reasonable amounts of money becomes necessary. As mentioned in numerous other reviews  daily tasks are very difficult to complete  but can be accomplished by: 1. Playing every few hours for 5 minutes at a time using your free  rechargable energy. 2. Pay for energy  diamonds and or items. I find the items fairly priced. Thank you for a fun game!,POSITIVE,0,0.999501705,20-Feb-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Fun game  addictive  but very imbalanced cost/benefit ratio. Either you spend fortunes on the game to be able to make progress or you won't progress at all... Too much demand  too dim rewards. For example  the Surf Shop. Eight levels to complete. Several sub-levels on each of these 8 levels to complete. Way too much coins needed compared to the rewards given. 3200 coins for a sub-level. 3500 coins given for a Cotton T-Shirt that needs 1024 energy points to make.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998494983,5-Feb-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I enjoyed this game for the first couple of weeks I played it. But once you get past a certain level  the only way to complete the daily challenges is to buy! It took me 1800 energy to complete one order today! And it was for a single item. Game gives you 1 energy every 2 min w/100 max. The only way to complete orders in a single day is to buy  and the only way to complete the daily challenges is to buy a lot! Don't waste your time playing unless you plan on spending money!,NEGATIVE,1,0.995682836,9-Feb-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,The game is fun  but addicting. If you want to complete daily and or weekly tasks it will cost you to play. You need around 3000-4000 energy to complete tasks. To complete picture albums you basically need to complete weekly tasks. I would have given a better review except they updated the game to make orders harder to fill and changed the graphics to look childish and cheap.,NEGATIVE,1,0.94753468,12-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I started playing this for some easy entertainment and I haven't stopped since. It's so easy and enjoyable  I love this game even if my partner makes fun of it. I invest a good amount of time per day in it and I love how it has evolved. No unnecessary ads and no thousand pop upd when you open it. Sometimes I dislike the chances of items and having the same very hard item repeatedly asked for  but that's minor. Hope it keeps getting updated along!,POSITIVE,0,0.999714673,11-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Fun game. However  it takes way too much energy to merge common items  and there's no way to gift friends energy. Plus  when friends are gifted items such as collection cards  there's no place to see those cards  no way to show you/they received the gifts. Due to the incredibly high levels of energy required and the lack of cooperative play  I will likely end up uninstalling this game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99785322,8-Feb-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Am I missing something? I get 100 'energy'  which means 50 double-energy taps. A limited time bonus order pops up asking for items that would take 100s of energy to obtain. What's the point? If the devs think I'm spending real money  they are as dense and narrow minded as this game. It's monotonous at best  frustrating is coming soon. Go take tips from successful games  that I HAVE spent money in  like Merge Mansion. I'm looking for another one of those  not this.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999336064,12-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,It started off as a fun game but as you progress through the levels you need a lot more energy to merge items. Your energy runs out quickly when merging high level items. If they increased the energy level while you gain gained higher levels it would keep me wanting to play the game. I've decided to delete this game at level 12  they've made it too hard to continue the progress,NEGATIVE,1,0.999375165,25-Feb-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,It's unbelievable  although you are receiving bad reviews instead of trying to improve you make it worse. Since the last maintenance not even the ads for extra energy we don't have. Apart from taking a lot of time to manage to finish an order  the energy it's very limited. You should be taking in consideration what the complains are  not do the opposite. I've been playing this game for quite a long time and I am at level 80  it's getting harder and harder to play it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999009848,28-Feb-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,First downloaded the game because the fun of merging item  but as the level is getting higher and also the difficulty is getting harder too but the total energy stuck in 100. So for me it is almost impossible for completing the daily quest except for buying the energy packs. The event was fun for collecting the card but it was getting hard to get new card even there's already group for trading because some cards are just rare. So I'll give 2 stars for the fun I've had in the past 2 years Goodbye,NEGATIVE,1,0.984005332,16-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Don't be addicted to this game. It's designed to take your money. otherwise  you'll be stuck and won't be able to finish daily tasks. It was good at first  but then then the developer became greedy. In order to move forward you need to deposit tons a lot of money. Even in completing an album  at first you could complete them by just finishing daily tasks but later on nope they start giving you repetitive cards. And the only way you could complete the set is the use of joker cards.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999020219,14-Feb-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I've been playing this game for more than year and have seen how it has progressed from good to bad and to worst very recently. The energy you get finishes in less than a min. Certain producers that give more than 1 type of item are wired in a way to produce less of what you need to complete present orders (like literally the developers just don't want you to complete orders and pay real cash for energy and gems ð®âð¨ð¤¯). It was a fun relaxing game at start but now I've come to hate it! ð¤,NEGATIVE,1,0.998835385,14-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I enjoy playing this game as it relaxes me. The game also keeps moving so I don't get bored of it. I could play for hours if my budget allowed it. However  for the third time today I clicked on my card pack to open it and the app just closes. When I reopen the 4 star card pack is gone. I think the size of some of the ads are too big as it glitches when I watch it and afterwards... No reward.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999256432,22-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Not worth it. Going to be frankly honest with you. Out of the many games I've played with over the years  this is one of the worst. It has potential though you don't get much to start with so it would take a lot of time to work on. You don't get much energy to start with. The game crashes every time I merge  making me quit and restart. Unbelievably glitchy regardless of wifi speed. And not enough resources or a good enough storyline. I'm sticking with love & pies. Hoping it works for you! â¡â¡,NEGATIVE,1,0.999761283,7-Feb-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I have changed my opinion in recent weeks  at the beginning this game was awesome  I have suggested it many times but now rewards reduced  no side travels in last two months  price for purchase tripled  everything becomes much more harder  it is impossible to finish a level less than one month in 70levels  it is not worth to play now.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998659134,17-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I genuinely enjoy this game. However each update makes it more and more impossible to play. The stationary is now impossible to get anything you actually need. I wish I could uninstall updates. While I don't mind spending money occasionally it is impossible to level up and complete orders if you don't. And the card packs are basically impossible to complete! Im really considering uninstalling if usability doesn't get easier.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996830881,24-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,It's a fun game but after you've reached top levels it becomes hard to complete daily challenges that eventually I had to spend money which I have to do all the time now to progress in order to get enough lighting and the items become more and more difficult to get even with extra lightning so one keeps on spending. I think after the card challenge is complete I'm uninstalling otherwise I'll be broke ...from a game,NEGATIVE,1,0.995262861,15-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I noticed that the game is often laggy and takes forever to log in to. Yesterday especially. The event that is going on right now is absurd. I can't get new cards and the sets of the cards are impossible to complete. It feels like opening packs is broken because of all the old cards I get. The trading system just doesn't make sense. You would think that the trading system is integrated in the game  but no  you have to go to facebook trading group and add these random people and trade.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999770224,17-Feb-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I loved this game  played everyday for months. Until I got to the animal stage. Cat or dog house stage. I tried it once and literally took 3 days of credits to get one item I needed. Game trying to force u to spend. Really disappointing. I will try to start over cause I enjoyed the game leading up to. Way to ruin a good game guys. Before this point it was a 5 star,NEGATIVE,1,0.975886822,16-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I love this game alot. I have reached high enough levels that it takes an extreme amount of energy to complete orders. I have also noticed with probulay 100 dollars worth of purchases to get to 60 like I am. The 2.99 purchase gets most then its like oh 4.99 or 5.99 ain't bad. But after all I have spent in the last 3 days the lowest costing energy is 7.99 and up. I would give 5 stars on this game because I am so addicted to it. But at this cost will have to delete it before my husband disown me.,POSITIVE,0,0.96233058,8-Mar-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,While the game is fun  the pricing is very high and disappointing. 100 coins is extremely limiting and costs are very expensive. Spoils the fun. The game uses up 40 diamonds for every 100 coins repeatedly when u have lots of diamonds. It's unfair as it does not do 10 diamonds  20 and so on. This makes poor use of our purchases!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999330878,3-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Fun game but can only play for a very short time as the items you get from the  producers  or completely by chance! So you end up using alot of energy on things you dont need. Then have to wait for it to replenish itself. I Wish they had a way to get energy! (Watching videos/ads for energy/diamonsa etc) you SOMETIMES will get a link on their FB page for 25 energy but that is literally it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.990755618,5-Feb-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I LOVE this game it's so addicting. The only issue I have is with the energy  I wish I could keep watching Ads in exchange for 25 energy but there's a limit in the amount of ads you can watch before you get prompted to buy gem packs. I find it annoying that after paying for the gem packs and using it on energy that the amount of gems you have to pay increases each time and the amount of energy stays the same.,NEGATIVE,1,0.988934577,13-Mar-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I love the game for its design. But it is very frustrating that the energy finishes so quickly and you either have to wait for hours or spend money. I'm on 35th level and I feel very upset each time I accomplish the task for 8000 and see another one worse 8200. Daily rasks are impossible to accomplish  cards collection is impossible to be complete to get reward.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999125183,3-Mar-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I have enjoyed this game   but I do not understand why you have to go through a bunch of stuff to win the extra energy. Most games just select you and you win. I am having a hard time completing this beautiful says I'm 90% completed  even though I have downloaded and played took surveys. I'm not sure what I am supposed to do? It will not let me move forward. I'm done with trying for the extra energy all the surveys and downloads are just not worth the extra space and possible harm to my phone.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999104679,26-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I loved the game  however  now I've reached over level 50 it's almost unplayable without spending money. Base Energy doesn't increase with your level  so you end up using all 100 energy within a couple of minutes. Thing is  it doesn't even get you close to filling an order. I'm currently needing one of the rarer drop items  and I used all 100 with no sign of it dropping. Gems are scarce at higher level too  so can't buy energy with those. Really disappointed.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998989642,21-Feb-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I enjoyed playing this game for a little bit  but unfortunately it's another game that you have to spend money on to get anywhere.Your board fills up pretty darn fast while you're trying to make certain items... Which takes forever. There is no option to watch ads to earn purple gems which sucks..you have to buy them..my board has been full for days and I'm not spending more money...I can't play the game at all anymore cuz my board is full and my inventory slots are full also ...Deleting game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999009013,11-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Terrible update! The new graphics design is awful  the chains are even longer than they used to be and feel almost impossible to collect. Forget the daily challenge - no chance! Why fix something that wasn't broken? Please  PLEASE return to the previous version and the design of the items.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999587357,1-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,The story and items are cute  but it's ridiculous that as the items level up  they cost the same amount of energy as the item's level. With the limited energy we get  that makes it take wayy too long to make any of the requests even at level 20. I get wanting to extend the life of the game  but this isn't it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999145508,28-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Started of really good  but the higher you go up the levels the worse it gets  it also was better at rewarding you when I first started playing but now it's mainly these card games which are impossible to get anything but a few small rewards  I have notified customer service that to get a reward that gives you nothing is no reward but they don't care  all they want is your money.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99350363,15-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,The game is fun anyway  The daily challenge has been designed in a way that it is impossible to complete without spending. The energy keeps being exhausted quickly due to the large amount of merging needed to get a particular item. They always request the items at the highest level of merge and keep supplying you the 1st level so you need to merge A LOT to get to the last level and halfway there  the energy is sure to be zero. I've got a job too  ya know? We can't sit waiting for energy all day!,NEGATIVE,1,0.995967269,26-Feb-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Read FB reviews  STAY AWAY! Takes a lot longer to reach goals  you can't reach dailys anymore unless you pay. They keep adding more levels to get 1 item but only allow 2 trades per day and to get 1 item or close to 1 item  it takes all your game energy so YOU'RE DONE PLAYING in less than 3 minutes then you have to wait hours before getting enough to play for another 3 mins and still never get the daily -_- Soon as this album ends I'll be deleting the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999583304,12-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I liked it at first. Now I'm realizing the energy runs out too fast and is expensive if purchased. If you sell high-merged items  you get almost nothing in return. The last month  every time I leave the merge board to open other activities in game  the whole app shuts down. Things are starting to be impossible between the app crashing  videos not rewarding and the actual cost of things on game. Would be different if the level ups actual increase your energy bar or items produced better items.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999712765,19-Feb-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,The game play itself funnish  but unless you pay  you're not completing daily objectives at higher levels. also  you have to friend people on fb to friend them in the game to trade cards  and you can't trade gold cards. It's very frustrating not getting to complete anything in the game without paying money to do so.,NEGATIVE,1,0.989604712,22-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Only downloaded this to earn fetch rewards. It's fun enough and helps pass the time. I'm noticing what everyone else is saying about the items using ridiculously large amounts of energy  in turn taking a very long time to finish. I won't be spending money on this game  but probably would have played even after finishing the rewards if it wasn't for this issue. I'd rather watch a few ads here and there to earn energy points,POSITIVE,0,0.60659492,2-Mar-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Why are the ads not working? I tap it for the 25 energy it starts to play the same exact ad and stops then restarts the game .nothing added. And now the new card game started and I can barely Play because I cannot get the ads to play successfully and also when I tap on a item that comes up for a free one with and ad same thing. This never happened before. I'd really like to be able play Please fix thank you!,NEGATIVE,1,0.997726262,23-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Was amazing before the last update. You were able to play without having to pay $$ just fine. Now it's pretty impossible to meet the daily goals  diamonds are few  and you need way more energy for regular items. Also  the new art is terrible. Downgraded for sure.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998462796,20-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I really do like this game HOWEVER it does charge me 2 energies per one tap (vs 1 energy on other match games). Since many of the items need you to match up to the max in order to use that max item to get another item  I find that it takes a long time to reach items given that I'm being charged 2 energy points per click.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997366011,18-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,You learn to like/love the game  but it's designed to where players need to spend money. Like others mentioned  if you don't  you have to wait hours to get more energy to play the game  as it's used fast. You can only watch maybe 3 to 4 ads per day to get extra energy moves. I dislike all the waiting and will look for another game that's similar.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997010231,5-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,This has turn into a money making thing only you all give repeats constantly  the side challenges are hard to complete  if you give us challenges to get free packs they are repeats we basically have to buy packs to get the golds when its coming to the end of the album  why not make the exchange at least 5 a day and do a gold rush twice a month like MONOPOLY this game is getting too stressful for me I use to play to relax now its an anxiety ridden game. A civil suit in waiting!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999152899,20-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,The game is addictive but the energy recharges so slow and finishes so quickly that it is becomes difficult to wait for it. The products are not giving the items which are needed to complete the orders and it's so frustrating to see repetitive produce come out of products. Uninstalling it. Stop advertising fake things.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997442961,17-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Played for a month  now I'm done with this trash game. The game makes you depend on energy to play and it refills so slow and it costs so much energy to play it! It takes almost 4 hours to fill 100 energy and once it is full you go play and spend all the 100 energy in 5 minutes then you need to wait 4 hours again to play (or pay with real money to get energy). There's no ads but it is literally P2P (pay to play)  which in my opinion is as bad as having ads. Would give negative stars if possible.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999777019,7-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,The game was fun at first especially with all the free energy. But as you play longer you'll require more energy and theyll give less freebies. So youll have to acquire energy through other means... If you buy them through the shop with diamonds every purchase becomes even more expensive (which is annoying). If you buy energy with money it is also very expensive considering its just energy for a simple game. There's so much more to say  but after a week it got annoying and boringð,NEGATIVE,1,0.998836815,16-Feb-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Game takes too long to advance to next rounds. You use all the energy Bars and still never achieve anything to move forward. I hope this will be fixes it's an ok game just wish I could move along a little faster getting items that match a reward to advance is overly time consuming.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998860478,11-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,The game is fun but after a certain level you'll need to spend money more than not to get through the daily challenges. What I find disrespectful is that they have an algorithm where if you spend money they increase the cost of everything until you go about a week without purchases  then they offer low prices. They need to offer better rewards for people that spend cash. There's also an issue where they seem to always give you more items that you never need. Not a coincidence  burns energy fast.,NEGATIVE,1,0.988588095,17-Mar-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,game was super fun and addictive but after level 50 the coins required to upgrade buildings are far too hard to gain and orders with items level 6 or higher take several hundred energy to obtain which can take days if you dont obsessively play and even then the money is only half of whats required to upgrade. also the xp gained from upgrading is far to miniscule it takes too long to finally level up the one level and then the rewards are 100 or under energy or a lower level toolbox or some gems,NEGATIVE,1,0.997646391,9-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,It's just opinion  but the new items are getting ugly... Those neon colors don't fit overall game aesthetics... first pottery got weird with blue yellow contrast and now roller coaster wagon got pink-blue-yellow while other items are red??? It hurts looking at it... :x Don't have any idea who is choosing those color pallets  but they really should be revised before rest of the will get messed up as well... Because they used to be nice and now they are just screaming at your face...,NEGATIVE,1,0.999713838,11-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I used to play this game every single day whenever I had a free moment  but the new update with the art equipment (I'm at level 85) is such a drag. The art of the updated items is ugly and unsophisticated and it is incredibly difficult to craft what I need  even though I have it maxed out. I will be dropping the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999799788,14-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Was fun. I played this game daily. Now I'm thinking of getting rid of. I'm at level 52. After awhile the daily quests started to take forever to even reach. Which in turn means you won't hit the daily challenge. And on top of that I barely get gold cards now for the card challenge they have. When I started playing I was able to do it all easily not so much now. Wish there was a way to trade extra cards for a new pack or even just trade gold cards.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995027244,10-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,This game is fun but when you reach higher levels it becomes difficult to get coins and complete orders. Energy refill time should be reduced and energy capacity should be increased from 100 to 200 atleast. The cards challenge is good but getting repetitive cards is annoying especially golden cards.,NEGATIVE,1,0.993130982,20-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,TT is still fun but not as fun as it used to be. It unfortunately requires wifi to play. In the past  it didn't need wifi. All these updates so close together. Ridiculous. ð¡If you demand too many updates so close together  you WILL continue to lose players  their trust+love for TT. New design upgrades on some items+PPs are POORLY EXECUTED!!! New=UGLY+HIDEOUS Art department is in desperate serious need to see an Optometrist!!! Why fix+upgrade items+stuff that wasn't broken? Old designs=NICER.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998891175,11-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,Really enjoy playing this game and the fact thats there new and exciting challenges.. however the time limits to complete tasks are too short (24 hours to complete 14 tasks). Energy doesnt regenerate fast enough but also we make wayy to little coins to reach goals. Merging coins to the Max level only gives 32 coins. Please reconsider because its impossible to get max rewards to be able to advance in the game. Also it would be great if you could play offline too,NEGATIVE,1,0.987593353,10-Mar-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,I love this game but the amount of crashing this game does for me is insane. Most days I have to open the app up to 5 times before it will stop crashing just so I can play. I have uninstalled and reinstalled a few times and I never play for long so it's not from over heating. I have no idea how to stop it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.988081694,27-Apr-24
Travel Town - Merge Adventure,This game is soooooo addicting and I LOVE IT! If there is a problem  which I only had one small problem  I was able to go to settings and message them and they took care of it within a couple of hours. Amazing customer service. DID I mention that I LOVE this game lol. There is only ONE thing that I truely wished they would change. Being able to have friends INSIDE the game that we can trade thongs like energy everyday and chat with inside the game and trade cards INSIDE the game!!!!,POSITIVE,0,0.999198139,21-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,Microtransactions are very greedy. You need to spend hundreds of dollars on each item (individually) to acquire base skins  drone skins  and other necessary elements to stay competitive. If you don't pay you just get steam rolled. You have no ability to fight back and it's just too easy for someone to buy everything. Bugs  lag  and stability issues are frequent. Everything is an upgrade and limited time items are converted to another item to prevent you from getting the top event prizes. Leave,NEGATIVE,1,0.999511242,27-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,I just wanted an app to run through the levels and try to choose the right path like you see in the videos. This does a pretty good job of that  but then you have to star building stuff and upgrading it. You get materials by completing some kind of task  but every time I log in all my soldiers are missing or everything is on fire with no explanation why. Uninstalling and trying another one. Why is it so hard to build a game that does what the ad says?!?,NEGATIVE,1,0.999264181,7-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,Their selling point is that it's  like the ads  that you see  but  then they fill it with this cringe story and awful filler. Stuff like builds with timers and only allowing so many builds at a time  things to dupe the impatient into spending. Would be a much better game if it was *only* the stuff  like the ads   which  even that part is dumbed down and poorly executed. TLDR; game claims to be just like the ads  is close  but much worse.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999746978,27-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,It's fun at first but mid-end game is repetitive  everyone's squads eventually all look almost exactly the same  it doesn't respect your schedule (it demands you follow the one the game sets)  server vs server and versus event are rarely ever balanced (usually a stomp one way or the other)  and very heavy pay to win elements. Little actually strategy involved. Both sides have plans but it falls apart within a minute when it's clear one is way stronger. Actual war is 1 day a week and over in mins,NEGATIVE,1,0.999577343,6-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,The price point is insanely high. Probably too high to be sustainable. Maybe if there was a trading and selling feature of purchased items to other players. Would be a good addition. *Lowered to 1 star. Customer Service is nearly unresponsive or non-existent. Not great at addressing glitching issues. And seem to have reduced compensation related to glitches. I can see why people have been asking for refunds and justifiably so.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999697566,4-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,Underneath the dozens of micro transaction opportunities within this app  there lies a decently enjoyable game. The waves of enemies that run towards you are enjoyable to take out. The only portion like the ads is special operations and it's ðby base level & takes hours to upgrade to play as many if those as you want. If you're easily overwhelmed or over stimulated this isn't for you. There's simply too many things to track in this app to keep efficiency low for users who don't spend in game.,POSITIVE,0,0.996069193,25-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,Game starts of decent and enjoyable  but after you beat some stages and earn some rewards  it becomes impossible to proceed without paying. It will literally take you days because of how long it takes to build just to beat an enemy. Easy way to see the greed? I got a popup for a $100 pack which is insane. Uninstalling for a different game that you can play without breaking the bank.,NEGATIVE,1,0.989866078,18-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,Well  pretty fun game.. Have no real issues with it  except for the mundane boring upgrade times? You load in twice a day  upgrade 1 building and 1 tech research a day  do some random radar stuff to get barely anything and that's it ð¤·. Then you wait another week before you can upgrade your squad to defeat the blocks and actually  never achieve the sense of fun? Like I said  not too bad  but if you want to stare at your phone for hours and hours whilst nothing is happening  then this is game,NEGATIVE,1,0.981327832,3-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,Love the game. BUT..... this game does not have a way to survive without spending a lot of money. Every weekend you have to spend a lot of money to buy a shield or your base gets destroyed and you have to rebuild. I wish there was a mode that allowed you to play  not allowed to attack anybody and not allowed to be attacked. Spend some money where you want to buy not forced to every weekend (spend a lot). I absolutely love this game but I have to uninstall it due to poor game management.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997541904,28-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,One star  because even tho the design and production are pretty good  the gameplay is NOTHING like the ads  AT ALL  there are even ads specifically denying this  but they straight up LIE. The actual game is a bunch of tedious resource gathering  boring levels where you can't choose anything  and overly complicated player vs player nonsense. Such a disappointment. PS the response to this review is a lie too  the option they refer to is also nothing like the gameplay in the ads. Blatant deceit.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999706328,25-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,I was enjoying the game for the last few months but I recently had to uninstall the app and then reinstall it. Since doing that  I'm no longer able to sign in to my account. It's not a  forgotten password  sort of issue. The game just says my old account cannot be found. I've contacted support through the app a couple of times and that goes absolutely nowhere. No help is being provided. It's just an AI chat bot that doesn't respond after asking what your issue is,NEGATIVE,1,0.99939537,23-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,This isn't the game in the ads. It's a city builder. No thanks. Edit to respond to devs: No  you didn't show just a part. Where in the ads you walk around shooting zombies close to you  in the game you stand in a single unmoving area  can only slide your character left and right  while a couple of columns of zombies come at you. That's like going to a buffet and being told all they have is warm milk to serve.,NEGATIVE,1,0.991294086,11-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,Ahh  man  click bait nonsense. Nothing as advertised. Actually  it looks fun in adverts but get into it  and it's just not great at all  sorry. Weird boring nothingness. Just move side-to-side automatically shoots. Boring. Probably good for 3 to 5 yr olds. Play a few games then requires you to do a load of base building. No good at all sorry. Uninstalled after 10 mins.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999611795,15-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,Gameplay doesn't match advertisements/not what was expected. Edit: gameplay featured in the ads is only 2% of the game. This is a bad thing because that's the only enjoyable aspect of this game and you're time-gated from actually playing the fun part of the game. Suggestion: make the  Special Ops  mode a separate stand-alone game (or are devs too cowardly to do it?).,NEGATIVE,1,0.999751985,26-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,The game is nothing like the advertising  it has a weird base building mechanic and the game play is completely nothing like what is shown and pictured. Community is toxic and it is just another pay to win mechanic where even playing the game for free quickly requires hours of waiting on  building  in between levels if you don't want to constantly micro transaction.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99910754,24-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!!! Developers' inability to resolve issues related to wifi and network connections make the game nearly impossible to play and enjoy. Also  games crashes nearly every time a  major event  occurs in the game. In addition to that  the countless numbers of bugs are infuriating. To top it off  it's one of the most  money hungry  games I have ever played. Do not download...and if you do  I wish you all the best,NEGATIVE,1,0.999558866,2-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,The game's pretty okay  but the player base is weirdly toxic. There's some good people in the game  but because it doesn't take a whole lot of skill and you can pay to win  it attracts a certain type that really detracts from The Cooperative gameplay. But if you need a tiny little bit of power in your life  this is the game for you I would have avoided it but the ads are slightly misleading. The moving back and forth and shooting piece is in the game  but only very occasionally.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997194409,2-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,The lag during events renders the game unplayable at times to the point you teleport away from battle but get hit like 10 times before leaving. The amount of resources lost because of this lag during events without playing the game is unfathomable. Customer service takes about 24 hours to get back to you with a literal auto reaponder that does zero. They say did you screen shot. How the hell do you screen shot lag. How dense are you. Money hungery and they will do zero for your loss of money.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999502301,9-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,The game could be better if some basic features aren't unavailable for some accounts. I don't know if I'm the only one facing this problem but all the features related to banner are unavailable in my account (Can't set a flag  can't see mine and others in chats nor in map). Reported the problem several times for months to the customer service where I was told to wait next update  after several patches and updates  the issue is still not addressed. Having missing features is quite frustrating.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999674916,19-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,Starts out great  then loses its appeal. The beginning of the game is great! Leveling up and creating the base  but after you start leveling up  it takes way to long to continue. It literally takes HOURS to level up the units within the base and takes a lot of effort to upgrade your team. I get things take time  but 24 hours to level up you home base...that's unplayable. Would be 5 stars if didn't take so long to level up everything!,NEGATIVE,1,0.997374892,4-Feb-24
Last War:Survival Game,Ads looked cool  so I downloaded it. Ads account for about 25% of the game. I gave it 3 weeks and about $5 to get an early boost. The various events are cool and keep things interesting  but it's not worth my time anymore. Make the attacks competitive  and the game would be tremendously better. There's no point in letting Level 120 pay-to-play whales attack newbie peons. Do better! Ciao.,NEGATIVE,1,0.991215944,10-Feb-24
Last War:Survival Game,The graphics are nice  pretty polished. The ux is cluttered  and there are tons of things to click on and lots of ways to spend money... BUT  the actual game play is boring as hell. It's so basic and automatic that it takes ZERO thought or skill. You slide your little people left and right  and THAT'S IT. You don't even have to think. You just move them to the blue lane. It feels super non-interactive for as busy as it is. Feels like a weak attempt to disguise the money pit it's drooling to be.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998900056,4-Mar-24
Last War:Survival Game,The game is constantly disconnecting  even after uninstall reinstall. My home wifi is stable  the game is unstable. It's next to unplayable. Not to mention the number of micro transactions  there are so many. You can not get legendary heroes for free. They need to add a way to limit who can join your rally. You should be able to block players under a certain power from joining when you are trying to fight a big monster. It's almost impossible to kick w/ rejoining. There are no ads at least.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997944891,15-Mar-24
Last War:Survival Game,Game play is primarily about building up a base. You are encouraged to join an alliance nd help the team. Different than the ads  not bad just different. Unfortunately  a few things ruin the experience. After a few levels  game play really slows down. It takes hours or days to upgrade buildings and research new tech. The rules encourage bullying behavior. Stronger players are rewarded for attacking weaker ones. Could be a much better game with as few adjustments.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999577701,10-Feb-24
Last War:Survival Game,It's not really a game. It is more of a entertainment and money begger. You have little choice on what to build  everything takes forever to build  your troops need to be upgraded every couple of stages  and for that you need to upgrade more and more your base. The graphics are nice  the concept is not too bad  but the game is just another one of its time - banking on its players desire to progress to get them to pay for speed ups and upgrades.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995671868,22-Feb-24
Last War:Survival Game,Good for about 2 days then it takes far too long to upgrade the buildings  heroes and skills research to be able to progress past levels (can take days to upgrade HQ). Constant attacks from other players deplete slow to gather resources with no way to stop other players from stealing your stuff (should not be attacked if not in an alliance). It is a clear design to get you interested initially and then try to get as much money from you as possible. Must be prepared to pay to win  and pay a lot.,NEGATIVE,1,0.939822018,6-Feb-24
Last War:Survival Game,Not like the ads at all. Even though the whole point of the ad is  this is real . Basically a city builder  with something almost like the ads. Not fun for long Edit. Thanks for the reply. No  what you show in your ads IS NOT IN THE GAME AT ALL! there is no gun upgrades. There is no  gotta shoot this snowball . It's a trivial version of what's shown in commercials. You can actually not move your characters left or right at all and still win.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994672,19-Mar-24
Last War:Survival Game,I'm all for upgrading kind of games  but there is the element of grind. The ads shown are only a small part. It gets to a point where it's not about skill but how strong your characters are. Upgrading does take too long like others have said. Level 7 is where I started noticing I just had to login  select which building to upgrade and then stop playing until that was finished. Edit: Lvl 12 and the numbers to upgrade are all out of whack and not worth playing. The grind is painstaking.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999278128,14-Feb-24
Last War:Survival Game,It's a falsely advertised  very boring  base building game. You'll rush up to lvl 5 and then it's just a slow grind from then on in  waiting for your structures to be built so you can upgrade the HQ  in order to progress further in the game and actually be able to do what the adverts  show you you can do. Or you can waste your money on the usual loot boxes etc.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999755561,2-Mar-24
Last War:Survival Game,Advertised as a scrolling run & shoot action game  but quickly changes to a very slow base building game pushing ingame purchases. Only a few of the advertised run/shoot levels are available for each base level upgrade  with no replay  or 'for fun' options. Instead you have to wait days for the build timers tick down before gaining access to the next few levels.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999440491,7-Feb-24
Last War:Survival Game,The VS and server wars are not fairly matched. There are also too many abandoned bases  and we are starting to think that maybe that's why our server has been lacking new players. It's been difficult to recruit. It takes entirely too long to upgrade any of the buildings once you get to around level 20. It takes even longer to obtain enough resources to make those upgrades. While there is an abundant of rewards  the rewards should be increased in size. Meaning more payout.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999585807,23-Mar-24
Last War:Survival Game,The game is cool and fun to play. The reason for the 3 stars is the extremely long time it takes to build/upgrade. If you plan on playing this game w/ no money or minimal money spent  I wouldn't waste my time. Taking 2  3  4+ days to upgrade a building or training soldiers is wild. You spend more time waitin for upgrades/training than playing. I feel the building/training speed could be decreased so ppl spend more time playin rather than waiting. Will change my review if this improves.,NEGATIVE,1,0.677127957,28-Feb-24
Last War:Survival Game,Not at all like the ads. The ad shows rows of bad guys nearing you w/ the # of hits needed to destroy. It looks like a strategic game of needing to make quick thoughts to fire at the right #'s attacking you w/ the assumption that clearing levels will level you up as it gets harder. It is more like a futuristic version of the recently renamed Rise of Castles. The ad merely shows a small part of the game you can rarely even play. Months of play and that small part has never looked like the ad.,NEGATIVE,1,0.989992797,14-Feb-24
Last War:Survival Game,Nice game  but like others said after 2 days or so it gets tedious. The upgrade timers are just too long and take out the fun of the game. I also expected a simpler game. I thought I'll just run the troops through levels shooting and going through the upgrade gates. In the end  this is something where you need to upgrade a base  harvest stuff (for no clear reason) and upgrade heros etc. I'm just not into that.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998024464,14-Feb-24
Last War:Survival Game,Edit: Generic trash reply by Dev. That's an uninstall.  Oh  its just like the ads  - every ad they have. It's not. It's false advertising. They did everything they could to make it look like the ad while having it be completely different. Levels in the ad are 30 seconds long minimum. Levels here? 5 - 10. You can't amass an army or anything. When you're done that  you get to play a population sim game. Nothing like the ads. Deceitful  but the game makers are already aware of that.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997483671,15-Feb-24
Last War:Survival Game,Starts out good. Fun in the early parts  building  killing zombies  mini missions. Then  when you get in the teens and a good size army  you get wiped out and destroyed by players way higher level every few days and literally can't do anything cause you have no troops. So basically a big waste of time. Not worth it. Pass this one.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99968636,23-Mar-24
Last War:Survival Game,Like all games of this genre  it's play to win. Wouldn't be so bad but like all games of this genre  it's a waste when there are no player restrictions. These genre fails for one reason  no restrictions on players higher levels from attacking players of lower levels. It's a waste of money when a player is ten power levels higher than you and can't do anything.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999724925,7-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,Yet another incredibly bland city builder desperately trying to make itself look like it isn't another incredibly bland city builder. Gameplay is janky  enemies get past you and it doesn't matter  you get tens of thousands of resources immediately which if course isn't anywhere near enough to do much. The music is depressingly bland  missing or terrible sound effects everywhere. Games like this are why mobile games are destined to be terrible forever.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99884665,13-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,I thought this game is going to be a game where you can idly play  some  braindead  types of game you know. But there's surprisingly a lot of mechanics. Heroes  bases  foods  irons  etc. You might be into this type of things. But I just see this as another layer for people to pay for some  progress . This is not the game that I wanted. But clearly a lot of effort was put into these  the art and models are great  animations are surprisingly nice too. But  this is just too much for me.,NEGATIVE,1,0.961786449,6-Feb-24
Last War:Survival Game,Game is laggy as hell which is absolutely awesome when you're in the middle of a fight for your server capital. The developers have admitted it's happened by compensating certain people in certain areas but if you're outside those little areas apparently the lag  invisible troops  inability to recall troops all just never happened All these developers are interested in is your money there lots of bugs and several patches a day (fix 1 thing break another). Some of the tech research doesn't work,NEGATIVE,1,0.996844292,28-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,The images advertising this game is misleading! This game is a P2W (Play-to-win)  and as soon as you start the game  all sorts of packs for purchase are rammed down your throat  which is annoying beyond belief. It's an extremely slow and GRINDING game. Some aspects of.the game are fun. If you have money to burn  play it  of course. Not for me.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997695148,19-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,It was fun on the first day. You fly through the levels  build quick  lot od different actions throughout the game  then comes day two. 2hrs of waiting for this  3hrs of waiting for that  I think I'm on day 5 now  totally stuck @ level 14 (8-10-14hrs of waiting for some taks to complete) and I have to seriously laugh at myself for thinking day 2 was bad. I used to play a similar and very popular game free for months. If you don't want to spend hard earned $$  don't think about downloading it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996918559,17-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,The screenshots of the game (what's shown in ads) is probably less than 5% of the game. And it's no where near what they show. Main game is building a base behind artificial time gates. You can play for a couple of hours before you are forced to a halt behind long build times and progress becomes non existent unless you pay for boosts.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999671459,25-Feb-24
Last War:Survival Game,Very difficult to make progress without spending money. I bought a few basic packs to speed things up. One week ago  I was looking at a pack  went to payment page but didn't buy it. Came back a few hours later and $21+ was deducted from Google Play account. I thought it was a glitch. So  I went back to that page. They deducted same amount again. $2.12 left on my account. I wonder if they kept stealing my money every time I was looking at that pack... Useless Customer Service. Filthy thieves...,NEGATIVE,1,0.999641538,12-Mar-24
Last War:Survival Game,Another misleading game where neither the advert nor the screenshots reflect the actual gameplay. Most of the game is farming stuffs for ages to build a base. What is advertised is actually just a tiny fraction of it. I'm not here to wait forever for building to build. I'm here to fight waves of zombies. Stop misleading people with fake ads!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999387264,3-Mar-24
Last War:Survival Game,Don't start this game unless you want to pay thousands of dollars to keep playing. The game is highly interactive but there is really no story or purpose or end... you just keep playing until you dont want to invest any more money into it. There is no end to upgrading anything as well. Too many moving parts- I found myself more exhausted than enjoying the game. I've slowed down a lot and i have also stopped spending money. Its also really buggy  especially the survivor section.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999660134,12-Mar-24
Last War:Survival Game,Starts out with gameplay as advertised. However  you then are forced to do some settlement building stuff that you can't skip and is basically you just tapping on what it tells you to for 5-10 minutes. Not worth that time sink to play a few levels of the actual game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998165667,26-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,It's advertised as a quick pick up & play shooting game but quickly turns into a very slow building game  which takes up ALL of your time. They've used misleading keywords to upgrade for real money & players have already spent over Â£1 000 to have an advantage over others  so if you're looking free to play or even enjoying the game on a budget  you'll soon become frustrated. As of Friday night  they force you to play a 24 hour mode against big spenders and you lose everything you've built,NEGATIVE,1,0.99969101,24-Feb-24
Last War:Survival Game,I've been playing this game longer than I wish to admit  and the ads show content that is not part of the game... unless it's at level 100000 when you have put in 12 years of play or pay thousands of dollars to unlock it. Free play is very limited. Once you reach a certain level  you will wait days to upgrade anything  and that needs to be done to continue playing.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999515176,22-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,The game is good so far! Its just that many people(which ik for sure) including myself want is to DEGRADE/RESET some heroes which we had already UPGRADED but there's no option for degrading/resetting. It will be really helpful if we could DEGRADE/RESET some heroes that we don't use anymore and get the used tools back in return which we wasted on those unused heroes  so that it could help us in upgrading those being used at present.,NEGATIVE,1,0.940163195,4-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,The premise of the game is fun  why 1 star? Because it is another pay to win with a billion micro transactions  you'll have to pay (a lot) if you want any progress. In the beginning  you can progress fast  but then you'll get stuck and having to wait a collective of long hours to upgrade anything is pretty much unplayable.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997179985,9-Feb-24
Last War:Survival Game,The game play is fun  getting materials and speed ups somewhat easy. However Game is some what of a cash grab pay to play. Most legendary toons are paid to play  All thing can be sped up or upgraded with paid option. And at a certain point you get the idea it's pay to play  I just did a battle and made progress after DAYS of upgrading squad. Also every fight after I have done worse than that attempt with uprading my squad more than 10 times. Classic cash grab game. Be warned,NEGATIVE,1,0.990697801,26-Mar-24
Last War:Survival Game,This game was fun for maybe 2 weeks and now it is the most boring game I think I've played. It's like you hit a wall of being able to do anything in the game not to mention the pictures and ads are not at all how the game works only a small part of it. Once you get past the first ladder of missions and unlock your full base you quickly see how boring it gets. You also get to an inevitable point where your troops aren't high enough level to do any of the missions or any of the events.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999536395,6-Mar-24
Last War:Survival Game,I'm not sure why this and other games have an increased time per level scheme. It makes the game unattractive quickly. Sure it's fun for a moment... but that passes and frustration overtakes that.... not sure how or why developers even consider that route. It's basically self-sabotaging your own game. The inconsistencies that have shown up over time in the game seems as though a trap to get people to throw away money... noticeable glitches and errors left and right in this one.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999584973,29-Mar-24
Last War:Survival Game,False advertising. Pay to play & lots of hateful private messaging by players that do dump loads of money in the game to play. (They force you to either buy an add-on or purchase it  EVERY single time you open the app. No turning the purchase overlay off. People private message you a LOT about paying to play the game or quitting it altogether.) They sell $99.99 package deals to play a mini arcade game. That's absurd  except people really DO purchase them & get mad at you for not doing so.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998583794,29-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,Nothing about this game is skill based and thats what irks me the most. Its all a matter of having strong enough troops for the level which often means having to purchase additional characters  resources or having to wait snd grind for a long  long time just to progress 3-5 levels and get stuck in the same loop again. All the busy tasks you can do while you grind and can't beat a real level are incredibly boring. Just click here   click there   claim this claim that  just boring as hell.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99969244,12-Mar-24
Last War:Survival Game,Repetitive gameplay. In for a couple months  the dynamics within the kingdom is interesting though the servers not so much. same duel event every week  waiting to do tasks for the event. then it expands to older servers. then it expands again. almost like the newer you are the harder it would be. I'd like to see more game play within the one server and different events. Marshall is just a rally on one thing  nothing strategic. If you do invest expect repetition,NEGATIVE,1,0.943723917,11-Mar-24
Last War:Survival Game,Pros: First week is actually fun. Graphics are solid. Vehicles are great toon characterizations. The mini games are fun. Great way to use up 15/20 mins here and there. Cons: P2W. Typical structure that allows continuous toxic assault from higher ranked alliances and players against lower level players. (Please don't mention purchasing an 8 hour shield). Waiting 6+ hours to complete something is not motivating to log in and play. Verdict: Played for a week/Deleted,POSITIVE,0,0.946949184,8-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,Not bad but not as advertised. I liked the lay out and tasks at first but its expensive to progress at a decent rate. You get some freebies but nothing like what you need in cutting build times  hero upgrades and development. I've spent Â£13 at level 18 but waiting times are getting to 3 day's with only halving it at best with all mission completion. Waiting 4 days to advance to next level or even competing against higher zombie levels. Â£200ish I recon u need to enjoy this base build game?,NEGATIVE,1,0.97208643,7-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,Sad and expensive. You can buy your way to the top. Many balance issues in vs. One guy level 30 can lay waste to your whole team 100+ people  and there is nothing anyone can do. I wish I could get a refund for all the money I have spent. Just to get a base skin cost 400 dollars  and the mini game you play to get tickets is rigged. I have never gotten from the boxes more than one ticket at a time. The whole system works against you to get you to spend money. Just another day before scam,NEGATIVE,1,0.999559343,10-Feb-24
Last War:Survival Game,I'm leaving only 2 stars for many different reasons  this game is honestly good for the first hour but then quickly shows all of its cons. I first downloaded the game because of the ads making it look appealing  then I started to see that this game is trying to be like too many other mobile games like Rise of Kingdoms  Top War  and some of those tower defense style games. I feel like this game doesn't even know what style game it is. I would keep going but only allowed 500 letters. ð¤,NEGATIVE,1,0.995100915,3-Mar-24
Last War:Survival Game,Initial stages and upgrading headquarters was quick. Now  the more you upgrade and level up your headquarter  the more time needs to be spend to level up buildings and other parts. Moreover  we can't level up 2 or 3 things simultaneously. When you reach at level 15 or more  it take more than 24 hours to level up. Pathetic. Now the game is getting boring day by day.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999563515,25-Feb-24
Last War:Survival Game,Awful. Full to the brim with quickly thrown together AI generated assets and voice acting. Disgusting visuals with no coherent art style (because its AI generated  most likely)  extremely predatory microtransactions  slow grindy chores  bad audio mixing... everything. At least it actually has the mini game it shows in the ad I guess.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999817193,15-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,Is ok as advertised but gameplay lacks depth  as you progress it becomes less about skill and more about getting app purchases out of players. Moving left and right can only go so far i guess . Initially there isnt much .onetization but it folllows the same formula  1 rope player in get them invested   2 get that first iap. Then 2 years later you look up realise you dumped 100s of dollars on a game you wouldnt spend 20 on in steam.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999337375,24-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,I've been playing for a few months now even thought it is NOT AT ALL what is put in the ads. You have to build and upgrade a base and OCCASIONALLY you donwhat was shown in the ads. But after playing for a few months this game is not only a money grab and extremely pay to win but because of that the whales rule everything. There's a bunch of bullying that happens in the servers and nothing you can do about it unless you want to spend literally thousands. This games is toxic af don't install.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999407053,21-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,They will call you  Commander  and apologize. I wanted to play the left/right multiplier game in the ad. You get to do that RARELY. Most of what you do is collect  Heros  and upgrade buildings. After about 15 minutes of building your pase  you get entered into a multiplayer world where pay to win is the expectation. It's a beautiful expression of addiction mechanics in action. But it is not a good use of time. I am NOT a  Commander   Rivergame.,NEGATIVE,1,0.991296291,2-Mar-24
Last War:Survival Game,Radar mission excavation digs have been messed up ever since the new drone dig and dig help rewards update. Excavation dig probability says it stayed the same but is actually only occurring at 1/4 of what it previously was. Also day 6 for alliance duel is broken. It's far too difficult to get points. No one wants to actually play. Everyone just bubbles up.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999518394,20-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,Even the ads are saying the gameplay is as advertised. Nope  it's a base builder. Repsonse. I would say some of the minigames are styled like your ads. You show zero gameplay in your ads. I did try your game  it's a time-sink click fest. I would say false advertising  no where do you suggest there are any base building  not one word or picture. Get your ads company to make a game  looks like they could do a good job.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999664545,5-Mar-24
Last War:Survival Game,Game that is somewhat fun  different than ads  and has whales that spend a lot of money so they can bully you (destroy your base). You really have to like building a base and the grind (building upgrades take longer and longer the better you get). There are a lot of people that spend a lot of money on the game  and they can just destroy you in the game. Also lots of bugs(like spending in game free gems and not getting items as well as from fight zombies). Customer support non-existent.,NEGATIVE,1,0.993989229,17-Feb-24
Last War:Survival Game,Pay attention to the negative reviews for this game if you are considering playing-- they are pretty on target. Highlights to consider: 1. Not that similar to the ads beyond the first few levels 2. Incredibly pay to play  you will be farmed for resources unless you shield constantly. 3. Game is reeeeeally glitchy/ has significant lag 4. Customer support is not especially active or helpful. Even if you reach out with a glitch  they won't necessarily do anything to make it right.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999595582,3-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,Fun game but highly predatory constantly pushes  deals  or  value buys  in your face with no way to turn those things off. It's game with pay to win mechanics that has a free to play option  which makes being able to participate in the events of the game impossible. By the time a free to play player is able to do anything  most of the people they know will have left the game and moved on. Would give less stars if I could,NEGATIVE,1,0.99429518,17-Mar-24
Last War:Survival Game,Besides the prices being overrated in this app  the gameplay itself is good and fun. The times for research and healing or training troops are inadequate as the vs challenges are weekly by the time you are about to heal up another wave of attacks come thru. Everything on the app is very expensive  with little rewards or tresure chest in return. Definitely not happy with the way the gameplay  it forces you to have to make a payment to speed things up.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99464792,7-Feb-24
Last War:Survival Game,fun but just winds up being another generic game of recycled images from PvZ zombies to big helmet soldiers. the main ad for the game showed a style of game you only play once in awhile. most of the time you're clicking constantly on random stuff to build a base for some reason. got old after four days and I had no interest in paying real world money for any of the many resources you have to have to get by and be able to play the game you download this for.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999714792,21-Feb-24
Last War:Survival Game,The game is the one from the add so that's good and overall it's a pretty good game with great graphics. Really my only problem with it is that it is so slow. There is barely any action. You get to do a couple of battles before your heroes are outmatched and you have to upgrade a bunch of things which takes a long time. You can pay to boost it and improve this but that would still only get you a few more battles before you'd have to do it again. Not worth it,NEGATIVE,1,0.722144604,27-Feb-24
Last War:Survival Game,It's 100% pay to win. Yeah  you could spend years  literally  but if you want to catch up to other players  you will spend a ton of money. The game itself  once you have reached the endgame  is boring. There are about 15 min of things to do after the server resets  and then nothing but a couple fights against the trash on the map. Stamina is VERY scarce. The alliance battles are PTW. You don't need strategy  just money. There's a reason it's #1 in top grossing strategy games. Sad game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998989165,1-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,As expected  litterally not the same as the ad. In the ad you see uninterupted gameplay where your character move  in the game you stand in place and move side to side for 12 seconds then the level end. Annoying music and insanely long loading time. Please stop advertising before you fix your game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999608457,10-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,An Addiction too Speeding up time and being continuously set back due to poor network stability while in doors or not near wi fi. Game struggles on data at times and it refuses to let me load a custom image no matter what I try. Other than that. I love it for a generic RTS,NEGATIVE,1,0.991812229,28-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,The  temple run  style gameplay you think you've been promised (and shown in the main page here) is actually available in the first 3-4 days  after that it's nonexistent. It surves just as a mini game in most of the tutorial of the game. The whole app is really a base building  hero upgrading MMO pvp style game that closely resembles State of Survival  and other similar to that... Another false advisement in other words... Edit: The screenshots posted by the devs btw aren't even real gameplay...,NEGATIVE,1,0.999464333,16-Apr-24
Last War:Survival Game,I like this game  but other players take a lot of the fun out of it. The mini games and base maintenance are fun  but my biggest complaint is how often other players can pilage your base. There are shields to protect you  but unless you're paying real money  this is not a sustainable option. It's discouraging waking up every morning and seeing your base has been pillaged several times  and you have to spend the day grinding everything back.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998619199,30-Mar-24
Last War:Survival Game,Honestly  don't waste your time. Like most other reviews  once you get to mid teens you will just constantly get attacked by people who pay to win and are much stronger. There's no checks and balances and the game loves that because they try to get people to pay money to be able to compete. If you love to spend money on a game just to barely be able to compete this is the game for you. And devs  don't waste your time with your generic response. No one wants to spend points to just shield up,POSITIVE,0,0.988435745,16-Apr-24
Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,I enjoyed this game to start however the last few times I've tried to load it it pops up and tells me it has a timeout issue. I've not been able to play it for some time.

Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,I've been playing for 15 minutes now and it's still tutorial. It's just watching cooldown bars time out and then pressing what the screen says. No game so far. The worst of it is I can't access the settings to turn the sound off to listen to music or a podcast to get through this long and boring tutorial. Maybe the game will make up for it and I'll change my rating or maybe I'll give up after another 10 minutes.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999744952,14-Feb-24
Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,Great strategy game until you hit level 6 or 7  then it becomes a grind. I'm uninstalling at this point as it's either paying for things or waiting it out. Not what I want from a mobile game  ð. It's reminiscent of old top downs like Age of Empires  which is great  but after a few logins  it gets stale waiting to get more powerful  more resources  complete quests that you can't do because you're not powerful enough.... gets a bit boring ð´,NEGATIVE,1,0.999249637,13-Feb-24
Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,Update Feb 11th '24: I'm now at 16 GB space for this game. When deleting and reinstalling the game  it has like 4GB until it starts downloading all extras onto my phone.

One more step to stop playing after 3 years. Very disappointing.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999237657,10-Feb-24
Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,Fun game to play. Was fun to play but too many updates and other things causes game to lag  causes disconnects and get booted from game.

Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,Game is great so far. Would be better if the developers will update on heros story. I really would like to see the castle walls changes after a certain level.

Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,No doubt that this game is so good in graphics and story line. The only problem I encounter is  even you have a good internet connection it always goes reconnecting and go back to main page. Too irritating yo play. Can't play as good as you want due to its server setting particularly in signal preception. Can't enjoy playing if this always like that.,NEGATIVE,1,0.986733913,8-Feb-24
Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,Game is super fun and has a lot to do and very big castle to expand!! Which I love watching my kingdom grow!:) good starting materials to help you grow in the beginning too! Down side is it is major pay to win which I completely understand ppl who pay should be stronger then people who don't. But some events are straight pay to even compete which is kind of sad. Still a very good game and having a lot of fun playing,POSITIVE,0,0.998885334,27-Mar-24

Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,Game is gradually turning more and more into a pay to win game. Unless you have thousands of dollars to spend each month you wont be strong. Every week something new required to be competitive. The developers greed is ruining the game for me and many other players who have supported the game. If the developers dont make changes to help the free to play or small spenders the game will soon be dead. Warning for the developers  many players are quiting and will quit  because of your greed,NEGATIVE,1,0.999751985,27-Apr-24
Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,I've been playing this game for almost 4 years now. Earlier it used to be good and balanced but now it have become just a spenders arena. I've seen my mates who spend regularly and with no limits and me am occasional spenders. The gap is just too huge and more over the new events is just to drain your wallets out as you can't get the best gifts unless you spend to buy it which gives you power in game. For players like us who don't spend much it have become a real let down.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998993337,23-Mar-24
Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,This game is getting so boring after you reach certain level e.g. 20 level. After that OMG it will take unbelievable amount of time/money to progress with ridiculous demanding resources to finish assignments or upgrade buildings. You constantly draw attention before weekend putting shield on otherwise your castle getting attacked losing many resources even you are not interested in playing it. It's getting so boring since you repeat almost same thing every day. No great improvement will uninstal,NEGATIVE,1,0.999473989,14-Apr-24
Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,Rise of castles is pretty fun. I'm not so serious to try fighting and battling other players but unlike other games I've played it doesn't seem like the other players are out to beat down smaller players making it frustrating.

Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,Well you better be ready to pay  and it's not budget packs or specials. I couldn't get above lvl 5 and I purchased a $.99 cent pack. I'm not going to apologize for not spending 20$ right off before I know I like something. I wish I hadn't spent that. The tutorial doesn't explain anything and you can't get enough gold or diamonds or workers for that matter  to do anything. No I didn't like it at all after playing 2 to 3 hours and spending money. I didn't like anything but the dragon.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996411026,6-Apr-24
Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,It's absolutely inappropriate that the game ask you to pay for changing avatars and once you purchased that it punished you for every picture you try to upload.

Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,The hand constantly pointing to the task list and you haven't completed building what is in the task list is annoying. I've just started and I'm not sure about this game  I'm leaning towards un-installing. Also the chat is there. I'm just starting the game and am only on level 4. I dont know if there is a way to shut off the chat stuff yet. I dont play games for chat with other players. I play games for mind numbing relaxation. I have played games like that before and its all drama.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998975635,19-Feb-24
Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,So far i like it so its 2 stars maybe 2.5. Reason being is the intro on how to play the game is way to long imo i had hope for somthing closer to roman empire or seige and concour kind of game play but so far getting  do this  then this  then that.  Anoying alerts to saying   do this  let me upgrade my troops before choosing to do what you want me to. I have 1ish hours so far and just seems very slideshow so far and not so much me being the determining person of my kingdom. Will reevaluate soon,NEGATIVE,1,0.997116923,2-Feb-24
Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,The game is very well put together with a lot of development happening on a regular basis. You can see the attention to detail.

Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,Game is fun so far  and visuals are nice.

Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,Very well made game. Unfortunately it is very expensive. Most of your first purchases are 5$ and over. Your first builder is 5$  you're first gold leader is 5$. There are no 1$ packages that I saw. Other packages are 25$ and over. Also the screen is very clustered. It is full of things they want to sell you. It's just too much pushing to sell to enjoy the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.931918025,27-Feb-24
Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,I'm enjoying the game  but still only a two days in. Because it is similar to other games I've played  it is less difficult to figure things out  but not easy.

Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,Addicted. Some aspects of the game almost require spending money to keep up with peers. Advancing the dragon would take ages if you didn't buy packages.

Only because of this issue I am giving 3 stars.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99120599,9-Feb-24
Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,Abusive customer service practices. Expect there to be tons of bugs and glitches typically around things that cause you to lose large amounts of money or resources. Basic game functions break and only time is spent on new things to force you to buy.

Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,Try build your castle while constantly getting attacked by players that have been on for years the more you progress the more boring it gets as everything takes longer too do enjoyable at first becomes just same thing every day but takes longer and longer as you think your making any sort off progress and if you don't have a peace sheld on constantly players that are more advanced jump on you and u have too start again and again boring unless something changes,NEGATIVE,1,0.99865216,21-Mar-24
Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,This is my First time playing this game amd it is very fun  there are some people giving bad comments about this game because the problem is that they don't have Patience. Yes  some people use money to become stronger than others but for me i like the rough road  I'm playing this game now for 2 weeks and I've reached level 11 castle without using any real money.

Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,I quite like the game  the speed up boosts really help. There was a story laid out in the tutorial but havent seen dialogue for it past a certain point. My biggest issue is how much higher the amount you have to spend on combat power and boosting things  seems like you need to do a lot of grinding to fight the higher levels  even at a lower level (for example  level 1:2000  level 2: 4000  level 3: 20000). I can easily see how this would be a  pay to win  type game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.989018559,7-Jan-24

Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,The most pay to win game in the world. Even the hero skins  castle skins  legion skins  etc. (Anything that is a cosmetic comes with buffs) are pay to win because it gives buffs.

Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,My point is for developers  a player is consistently given title of Fool from last 3 months due to which player can't attack during week days and always have to shield which forces that player to leave the game bcz of the personal issues with the big players who have monopoly over thorne. Considering this fact hundreds of people have left the game and many more will. I hope the point is home to the developers team.,POSITIVE,0,0.637772501,9-Apr-24

Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,Screenshots are fake  game looks nothing like that. It's a fun game until you realize the amount of time and money you need to invest to keep up with the growth of everyone else  otherwise  you'll be too weak of a player to withstand attacks. You basically have to be on hours and hours just to keep up and not burn into nothing. In summation  it's long and difficult to build up your army and resources  but super quick and easy to lose it all. That's how they make their money.,NEGATIVE,1,0.981413484,12-Jan-24
Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,The game is strategical fun but very expensive. For instance when you buy castle decor don't give a slight chance to get the decorations.

And last 5 seasons in eden we ve been matched with 709 V9V and we ve been out matched by easily 50 to 1 . Some of those players dont even lose 1 % of their troops after every eden.

Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,The VIP shop has robbed me of EXP Gain. Since this isn't the 1st time  in fact  it's the 3rd time the game has done this  so I am dropping my rating. I'm talking thousands of EXP!! Today  the wheel stopped on a very  high #  over 90k EXP  not even 2 seconds later my excitement changed when I noticed the wheel spin again ON ITS OWN and stop AGAIN but on a low# under 4k.

When the tutorial is finished I try to log into my previously existing and bound account. The system will not let you log in to any previously bound account. You have to continue to try and find your last account. It will try to bind the forced ''New  game to your other account passwords.

Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,Classic pay2win trash with stingey drop rates of actually decent heroes needed to compete. Even the pay2win option isn't good value since something better than what you just bought gets added a month later.

Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,Pay to play. I've been playing this game for over a year and when I first started  sure you can pay to get more resources and further advancement  but the game hinged on strategy. Fast forward a year later to Christmas of 2023 and today the games exclusively for those with fat wallets. The spanders control everything on every map. There's literally nothing you can do to stop a big spender. It's pathetic. Also  the game has bugs that sometimes destroy your progress  developers don't care.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997803748,24-Dec-23
Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,Really liked this game. Until I bought a pack stating there were 20000 gems in it. After purchasing the pack  the developers realized they had made an error with the amount of gems. Instead of fixing the problem and dealing with the small loss of FREE DIGITAL gems  they decided to still charge me  but remove all but 2k of the gems. So not only false advertising  but breaking a finalized sale contract and stealing. Won't recommend to anyone ever again.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99077493,21-Nov-23

Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,Absolutely terrible customer service. If you have a problem in the game  it takes over a day to get a response and they close the chat immediately after before you can give a reply.

Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,Updating my review lol still a 1 star. The game is only fun if you have a big alliance. Seriously I've been playing this game for 2 years and unless you spend big bucks you will not enjoy the game unless you join an alliance that has big spenders. premise of the game is to get heros and beat other players heros. There are heros you can only get if you buy them. If you plan to play for fun join a big alliance because if not you will always be behind and never get to play for fun without $$$$$$$$$,NEGATIVE,1,0.932962477,3-Feb-24
Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,Awesome game would recommend it... but It is not like most games of this nature... In order to progress in the game the developers have decided to force you to spend money  it truly takes the fun out of the game!!!

It's a shame because it has potential,POSITIVE,0,0.965371788,1-Jan-24
Rise of Castles: Ice and Fire,This game is very dependent on what Providance you end up in each one makes their own rules on who you can and can't attack so you need to find out early on what style of play you want to do.

Real Cricketâ¢ 24,Great game  one of the best on the mobile platform when it comes to cricket. I have been playing this franchise since rc17 came out  and have played every game it has offered. It has had a brilliant upgrade. There's just the issue that  I get 6 wickets early on by the 1st half of a t20  and it's like 70 for 6 in 10 overs  yet the remaining bowlers hit runs to get it to 180  the timing meter doesn't even show green.

Real Cricketâ¢ 24,There are many issues in this game : 1) Opponent team always play defensively and every time ball connects then they run singles and doubles and there is no chance to get opponent team allout. It's very hard to take more than two wickets of opponent team. 2) Dot balls are very difficult to bowl. 3) There is no chance to got out batsman by lbw  caught behind and bowled. 4) Opponent team take two runs easily where only single is possible.

Real Cricketâ¢ 24,This cricket app is very good. The games realistic graphics and the empire's actions are also very realistic. I like this game because it has more options to play and try new things. But this games need more updating and installing. Keep this game up and try new games like this.

Real Cricketâ¢ 24,TOO MANY ADS. The gameplay is good if not consumed by ads. You can't level up unless you play the tournament. To play the tournament you need coins. To get the coins you need to either buy them or watch adds which don't give you enough coins to play any tournament match so end up playing Quick match which makes the game boring. Even within that there's an ad after every over. Why??? Also the progression for leveling up is way too slow. I watch more ads than I actually get to play the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997526467,4-Apr-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,After the new update  the game is going quite well. However  there are two things I would like you to note.

Real Cricketâ¢ 24,One of the good games when it comes to mobile cricket games available. The number of shots available is impressive and the graphics are good. But the progression system is too monotonous and unrewarding and should be updated to make the system more interesting. The game feels a bit scripted at times  with opposition going slow in the powerplay but even when they are at 100/7 at 16 overs they will score 150 with tail enders.

Real Cricketâ¢ 24,Updates are made to make the app work better  not worse. The new update of year 2024 is the worst with lots of ads after every over  long wait before signing in and unrealistic graphics. What's worse is that once you've completely played a match  there's no way to go back home other than restarting the game. Also  no XP points are awarded once you win a match.

Real Cricketâ¢ 24,The game is smooth and has good graphics too. But there is 1 issue in Bowling. The cursor of bowling during pace selection moves very fast and it's difficult to judge.

Real Cricketâ¢ 24,I'd rather play the older version than this. Graphics are cool with the kits and everything. When it comes to game playð¤¦ð¾ââï¸it's sucks really. The bowler bowls and the batsman defends  very slow ball back at the bowler and the bowler moves away to have the Fielder take the ball and it's a run. When it comes to battingð¤¦ð¾ââï¸.

Real Cricketâ¢ 24,There is some glitch in the manual fielding setup during multiplayer mode. Even if I click on the green region multiple times during catching chances  the game doesn't take the input in certain parts of the field. For example  there were multiple chances to catch at the straight drive zone and when the bar appeared  even if I clicked multiple times at the green region it wasn't registered and at the end the catch was dropped. Real Cricket team  please look into this issue. It's a bad experience.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999626279,30-Mar-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,The game is excellent. But i will suggest you one thing about bowling. We can swing the ball anytime during the match which makes it unrealistic so you can add the ball condition feature in limited overs matches where the ball swings in the starting overs and stop swinging gradually during the course of the match. It will be much better if the ball  s conditions changes according to the pitch. Also there are very few dot balls in the match. Taking singles are very easy.,NEGATIVE,1,0.744218409,1-Apr-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,The game is decent but too many ads. There is one ad every over. Then there is also another problem. When I keep the joystick on the offside to hit an offside shot sometimes the batsman is hitting on the legside and if I lofted the ball I am getting out. So please fix this bug. It is kinda annoying.

Real Cricketâ¢ 24,I have a suggestion for you is when a batsman hits the ball in the gap and from that place where two fielders can go to the ball  only one fielder goes to the ball even if he saves the boundary. It is of no use because the batsman makes 4 runs by running . so  please make more than one fielder going for the ball .drain battery too much.

Real Cricketâ¢ 24,The game is very bad there was some difficult future's in new update 1 pitching the ball . When the bowler started running then seing the direction so cant make moving and bating direction it's very quik. Please make the issue. I am playing this game since2016. And now some time i was angry for the problem. And one suggestion to the button now star with the stroke please start with loft button.the next thing is ads every end of the over ads are coming it's very very irrelevant inthe every option,NEGATIVE,1,0.999437034,26-Apr-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,The older version of the app (before last two updates) was perfect. After the update the everything seems to have gone wrong. It gives incorrect info like number of overs by bowlers  skips balls and randomly adds dot balls anywhere  same bowlers bowling consecutive overs.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999190748,27-Apr-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,Yes man this game is good and best for anyone. But if you add two things it would become best. First is you can add a new type of thing. That is you add our own shot selection option like wherever we want to hit whatever ww can like Sweep Scoop and else.... Well it is best game..ðð»ðð» and second is you can please add IPL or any other related to it because it is very hard to go till 80-90 levels so please try your best and do these two things...,POSITIVE,0,0.996372938,27-Apr-24

Real Cricketâ¢ 24,I have played a lot of cricket games in my life in my mobile phone and I won't call them bad because at that time I thought they were the best game but when playing this game it feels like not in strong cricket mobile but cricket.

Real Cricketâ¢ 24,I have been playing real cricket from past many years I love this game. Just the thing to me mentioned before 1) you could play ipl and other league in quick match but now you can't so that's a bit Disappointing from my side ðð» Over all the game is good but we would be more happy if you added league games in quick match 2)Also : Only one stadium is free plz make it like two or three 3) the pro mode should also be added in the game it will be much more realistic That's all thank ðâ¤!,POSITIVE,0,0.972711802,28-Apr-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,Everything in this game is good but some bugs need to be fixed like fielding near the boundary. They should even provide some coins for Quick matches too so that it would be good for the coins perspective & would get some motivation.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997535467,25-Apr-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,The game is overall great  shots  graphics etc. But the problem is that tournaments require a lot of coins and tickets but there is only way is to get them is from quest. The coins are not enough we get from them. So you must add a way to earn coins by playing quick matches.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996454597,27-Apr-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,In recent times you guys have always made hardcore mode easy to win for user  specially in T20 match I don't see such hitting from the AI as it should be hardcore mode shouldn't be easy to win user should cry to get a win  but after the latest update yet again hardcore mode has been made easy to win for the user it is not great experience because AI is not as competitive as it should be in hardcore mode  please fix it  will be waiting for your reply patiently thank you,NEGATIVE,1,0.995755076,28-Apr-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,Ball pitching cursor appears too late and because of this it is impossible to move the batsman and select type of shot  direction and time the shots when people bowl negative line & length in multiplayer  it will be helpful if pitching cursor appears at the same time as ball speed & variation appear.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999618173,27-Apr-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,The game was excellent and Fantastic i love this game very much the graphics and all are good except one thing that is After the update every progress is gone iam playing tournament but after the update all progress has gone ðð IT WAS very bad and I kindly request you to please remove this problem ITS A 5 STAR GAME BUT ONLY THIS PROBLEM SO I RATED 3 STARS ONLY,NEGATIVE,1,0.899845481,27-Apr-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,Good game. Somethings need to be improved. 1. Many of famous stadiums are not enlisted e.g. Johannesburg  Oval  Aukland  Colombo. 2. No stadium from SL  Bangladesh  West Indies and Zimbabwe included. 3. When bowling one can easily concede 125+ meter sixes but you can't hit 87+ meter sixes. 4. Graphics should be clear when a catch is taken. 5. During bowling you can't get a wicket on LBW.,POSITIVE,0,0.950184703,25-Apr-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,Test mode seemed to be the worst. It is t20 style shot making. Do you not consider line and length in shot making? Out side off leg spin and that slower delivery How just a tapping four through fine leg? Till now I have not understood that the purpose of the batting timing meter in the game is. If the timing is wrong and the shot is played early or late  95% edge will not be taken  the ball will not be in the air  the bat will not even be beaten. Cricket is never a batsman's only game,NEGATIVE,1,0.999403119,27-Apr-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,Every time the app force u to update the game and all the data of your games and progress get lost. Its very bad as i used BDT 2700 Taka to purchase the rcpl aunction and after reaching to the final  before i could finish the match the game forced me to update and all the progress got lost. Very bad,NEGATIVE,1,0.999804914,27-Apr-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,Repetitive updates are nice...... But I lose any continuing tournaments and test series matches whenever the game is updated...... It's so SICK to give so much time to a tournament and then when you are in either a final round or semi final round...... New update arrives.....and all of it goes to ZERO...... Won't be updating this now or playing it anymore.......,NEGATIVE,1,0.999765098,27-Apr-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,The thing multi player (play with friends) Literally i can't play I mean I can't connect with my friend and every time I want to play multiplayer means i have to send an link to my friend in what's app soo.. it's irritating And lack of ads after every over and so many network issues like (waiting for the opponent)..ect.... otherwise the game is ok ð¥²ð and decent graphics...............,NEGATIVE,1,0.985035419,25-Apr-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,It's best cricket game ever i played... Amazing graphics and cool Experience too  but the in-game control is not good... Sometimes it's stuck on place  I press properly but batsman still there and cannot play i think it's a glitch because it's only happened in single player mode and when I play game offline. After all it's best game ever... (Thanks you),NEGATIVE,1,0.940070152,24-Apr-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,Apart from the graphics  everything got worse from the previous update. There are some issues I would like to address regarding the game: - Touch response got poor - Too many ads - Keeper catches doesn't happen - LBW is so rare when I am bowling - Runots/direct hits are also so rare. At least don't allow easy singles within 30 yard. - And while I'm bowling tailenders easily hit boundaries  at least make them beat  mistime or edge ball. Or else it wont look realistic.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994438767,21-Feb-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,A very realistic cricket game but after RC24 came then when I play in my device there is a glitch where the scorecard covers all the screen when I play a shot and after the ball comes to the keeper or bowler then the glitch goes. I have a 3gb ram phone also then why it is not working any solution and even phone processor is also good because it runs Free fire  BGMI very smoothly then why there is a glitch in this game. Please Reply Thank you,POSITIVE,0,0.817832947,28-Apr-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,The game is perfect. The faces of players need to resemble the real players if not 100% then at least 50%. In multiplayer mode  when one is close to winning the game  the opponent leaves or fortify the match  due to which we don't win MPS and XPs. This needs to be looked into. The commentary needs to be diverse. Commentators should at least mention the countries names or team names. The rest is absolutely perfect. Never seen any game of cricket better than this one.,POSITIVE,0,0.997480452,15-Apr-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,The game is excellent and also gives a great experience. The graphics and the shots are also very much realistic and awesome. The only thing missing is that there is no ultra edge checking when the decision of lbw is reviewed. My request and suggestion is that this ultra edge checking should be added in the game  then this game become the best cricket game ever,POSITIVE,0,0.999834299,15-Mar-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,Worst experience Not showing any xp's just stuck at level 8 from more that 3 months even after completing more than 15 matches . I cleared data and reinstalled . No option to change to my other play games. Multiplayer is too much lag   I am not sure why this happens where game starts lag when I am batting in multiplayer gets difficult to play shots and also in taking singles and Sets to Automatic field suddenly in middle and AI starts dropping catches and over throws costing games .,NEGATIVE,1,0.999549925,25-Feb-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,Forcing updates is the worst aspect of this game. Ok you updated but it should be the user's choice whether to install that update or not. Frequent compulsory updates irritate the user  so eliminate the compulsory updates and leave it to the user because I am doing this update for the last time  after that when the compulsory update comes  I will uninstall the app. And that's why I am giving it one star.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999550998,29-Apr-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,Game was good but when the difficulty was crossing the medium   the balls were really unplayable...... The expert and hardcore mode was really very much Hard.... So I rated only 3 stars. After I play the expert and hardcore mode   I thought playing cricket in real life is far easier than the game.... I am really disappointed ð .... At least the balls should touch the bat...the game was good upto the medium level ... Fix this kind of stuff....,NEGATIVE,1,0.993197441,22-Apr-24

Real Cricketâ¢ 24,Graphic and gameplay is so good. But it is difficult to grow up the levels. So we have to play more and more for rising the levels and unlocking different tournaments.

Real Cricketâ¢ 24,The game is very good the shots are realistic and graphics are all good but the one thing I'm not satisfied is that I can't get xp even after playing many matches I have played around 40 - 50 t20 matches but didn't earn a single xp not even my level is increasing. And the worst thing is after every over i have to watch an ad. I request you to clear this bug in the next update hope you would minimise the ads,NEGATIVE,1,0.998711824,10-Apr-24
Real Cricketâ¢ 24,I should suggest the game developers to fix the problem in multiplayer mode it is extremely annoying as whenever I am playing any multiplayer unranked game it crashes and I automatically lose that match.It is experiencing so much crashes which are so annoying.

Real Cricketâ¢ 24,Multiplayer sucks. Firstly opponent quit after batting or poor performance. It happens in almost every match. Many times even though I follow rules it doesn't allow me to report the player. Also add bigger over matches to play with friends . 5 overs is boring .

Clash of Kings,After playing so long I can say there is some positive changes in the game  still there is so many new things  quite impossible to manage by a new player but for those who playing long time or spend a good amount of money can balance their position.

Clash of Kings,the main premise of this game is keep building up and get stronger  and there are few rules: there are so many ads & game mechanics combined with ads which makes it very difficult to understand  you can't compete with the p2w players and they are everywhere. atm there are so many clutter and junk which you can't remove or disable like the announcement that pops up every 10s to encourage you to gamble or the towns with the winged dragons,NEGATIVE,1,0.997784555,23-Mar-24
Clash of Kings,I must admit  I was one of those players who found Clash of Kings almost impossible to enjoy due to the overwhelming dominance of big players. It felt like banging my head against a wall. But oh  how things have changed! The recent updates and additions have completely revamped the game experience. It's like a breath of fresh air!

Clash of Kings,I have been playing since December 2015. The game design is great. The developers are evolving the game to make it easier to grow  but something new comes out every 3-4 weeks.

Clash of Kings,A real live person who has played this game for years. This is now a pay for play game. Don't be fooled. A lot of bugs. I had my account frozen for 10 days by the developers for no reason. Every response from them was a bs ai answer and never provided a viable reason. Now every update requires over 6mb of free memory.

Clash of Kings,I would give this game a 5 star if it weren't for the following: 1. Absolutely pay to win - I understand the developers want revenue  but the level that you need to pay to be competitive and have enough resources to keep training troops and upgrading is ridiculous. I was top 80 in my server  and after being zero'd I could not regain what I had lost  I would have to spend so much money instead. 2. Spammy ads - the classic server is fine  but the new one is disgustingly unplayable.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999276102,22-Jun-23
Clash of Kings,It still just like old times  but you need to give some of love to your game. It's the same great strategy game  you keep it alive and that is good. Nevertheless  visually  it is ANNOYING  I don't remember my screen so filled of things that I can't even personalize; in addition  there are many bugs  above all in the interfaces (mail indicators frozen  entire game freezing sometimes...) You better review the entire game  it would be great to improve its design  to make it more comfortable.,NEGATIVE,1,0.918451905,13-Mar-22
Clash of Kings,I like the pace in which the avatar can grow and the graphics used in the game. Although  I rate it a three star due to some disfunctional parts of the game(though it may be due to my phone's limitations  I wouldn't be surprised)  there'd be tasks that I've already completed  but the system would deny my accomplishment(this is a general statement that covers the multiple problems that I've experienced).,NEGATIVE,1,0.963172913,9-Jul-19
Clash of Kings,Not bad  definitely need to spend money to have any chance of competing though. Also  if I'm getting attacked and I have ten seconds to load the game and put shield up  NO I DO NOT WANT TO BUY ANYTHING. I WANT TO SHIELD!

NOW a big problem... the game is stuck on the instruction screen to start building farms etc and it won't move on from that in order for me to reach the settings screen. Not able to do anything AT ALL. DISASTEROUS!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999744594,30-Aug-22
Clash of Kings,I'm a long time player  but wish I could turn off the annoying banners congratulating players in other kingdoms  WHO CARES? They're always in the way! If offline  even with notifications turned on with sound and vibration  you can be attacked and no warnings  you find out when you log back in  keep shields in place. Get in a powerful alliance and shield  or you'll be attacked over & over. And constant additions can be confusing even to long time players 5 stars to 2  it's declining every upgrade,NEGATIVE,1,0.997597277,15-Nov-22
Clash of Kings,It's a great game to play and yes of course money rules  but there are many inexpensive choices that keep you competitive if you know how to play. HOWEVER! certain countries (china) have unfair advantages with package purchasing getting better rewards at a fraction of the cost as well as cheater bots that help them grow at a phenomenal rate. FIX THESE INEQUALITIES ELEX (instead of adding heros and things that cause more glitching) and you will have a much happier player base.,POSITIVE,0,0.977073431,20-Nov-20
Clash of Kings,EXPENSIVE!! I've been playing almost 4 years. The game makers are continuously coming out with new updates that require spending money. There used to be benefits of spending money and getting rewards of gold during recharge events. The game is pushing out non-money spenders and making the game for wealthy players only. The game makers should fix the many glitches instead of pushing out more ways to spend money. As this rate  I wont be playing much longer and I know a lot of other players feel the same way. The game is dying.,NEGATIVE,1,0.986009181,28-Oct-18
Clash of Kings,It crashes all the time. I thought it was due to my phone storage however it was not the reason. I cant even spend more than a 5min. In this game.. And once you log out of the game and log in later....you cant already play the game...you need to restart and restart and restart and once you enter the gameplay  it lags a lot and after that it crashes...i have wasted my phone battery restarting this for a very long time.....so annoying and disappointing,NEGATIVE,1,0.999805868,21-Jun-20
Clash of Kings,Miss the old set up way too easy seems like just a bunch of button pushing and commercials sad to say because it looks better but the game as a whole has lost something.....was my initial feelings. But got to admit I was wrong. I really enjoy the new mechanics and heightened challenge.its just loads of fun. Thanks for all the hard work devs.,POSITIVE,0,0.994467735,20-Sep-23
Clash of Kings,It's my favourite game. It has a totally different experience from other games. You really feel like a king & everything around you feels so real. The gameplay is fun & smooth. Well done on this game. ** Edit: Hello. I recently can't play the game. When I start the game its shows the game name & then a black screen. Minutes after that it plays the loading screen music but the loading screen doesn't show up. The game doesn't start & it remains that way. Please fix this error as quick as possible.,POSITIVE,0,0.992171168,8-Sep-19
Clash of Kings,If I could give a lower rating  I would. Unless you have a lot of money to throw away  you can never hope to be in the top 500 players  let alone top 10. The developers create monster castles  move to a new kingdom every transfer to show the kind of stats you can get - for a price. Thousands of US dollars. Then they sell the castles they build. It's quite a racket. Game crashes during battles. Unless you're a big spender - find a different game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.965048432,12-Mar-23
Clash of Kings,Love this game  definitely entertaining and addictive but it's the best!! The only problem I'm having for a few days now is every time there is a weak or dead dragon it never shows it to me. I've uninstalled the game and re installed it and the problem continues. I hope it can get resolved. I spend money on this game because I love it but it just sucks a little that it's glitching a bit right now. Other than that it's fantastic!! Thanks COK for a great game!,POSITIVE,0,0.997871518,31-Jan-21
Clash of Kings,Bug in it...that's what it tells me. Installed on a new phone. It won't bind to my account and gets stuck in a build loop. Years of gaming lost...thanks a bunch Can't even access the game...just tells me there is a bug in the app and closes as soon as opened onto initial screen...so how would I be able to make contact whilst in game!,NEGATIVE,1,0.99972111,7-Nov-23
Clash of Kings,It's fun and full of details.and it has many events.. The only problem is there isn't an option to send in game screenshots.this make it hard to support new players,NEGATIVE,1,0.914425969,12-Dec-23
Clash of Kings,So far no problem about performance but the graphics look like a game from the 2000s. I think the developers need to improve the graphics and interface. Second  I'm don't want to turn off background music but background music is so loud even I'm adjust my phone sound in middle. Third  to growth castle base very slow since no plenty rewards objectives such as time speed and resources.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996891201,1-Jan-23
Clash of Kings,the game itself is great I had a lot of fun playing  past tense. Unless you are a rich Asian person or someone who wants to spend a lot of money this game is not for you. if they don't set up an optional no pay option in the game then you will constantly bee attacked and lose buy more powerful expensive castles. I for one don't pay to play so that is why I am quitting this game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995138645,26-Jan-19
Clash of Kings,Waste of time and money. They call this strategy game but is far from that as it can be. 95% of events in game are for money   you cant even play without a credit card. The game us boring and full of bugs . They over complected a game with things you need to buy just to participate. Game use a lot of memory but grafics are bad.So overall  don't wast your time even to install it ð¤·,NEGATIVE,1,0.999435484,14-Dec-23
Clash of Kings,I have played this game since day one. It eats up my phone memory. With every update  it stops functioning until you install updates and forces me to delete other apps to make room for it. They should refund all my money with interest. 8 years and very agravating but I have so much time invested. (I haven't spent much money but a lot of time). Some bugs have not been fixed for over 7 years and most messages to them are ignored!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999135792,22-Aug-22
Clash of Kings,The reason for my hate for this new update is because i can no longer read messages without the screen going black. Every time i open messages everything slows down and i can't see the message and cannot continue playing until i restart the game. It's so annoying with all these bad updatesð¤ the previous version was ok. This version is a struggle!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999312043,30-Oct-18
Clash of Kings,I've been playing this game for 9 years and I love it. My current problem is the fact that there's a share media permission issue between CoK and Android because I no longer can share screenshots to Help and Support. The share media permission isn't even an option in the app settings. This is the only app I have this issue with. Other than that  if you could slow down the game updates/additions  I would appreciate it!,NEGATIVE,1,0.876780033,18-Oct-23
Clash of Kings,As always cok is all about the money. If you don't have thousands to spend on a game  it's not worth playing. Even kingdom transfer that only happens every several months is geared to the strongest. (The spenders) only the top 60 castles get to transfer to the kingdom they want. Everyone else gets stuck where they are. Thanks for nothing cok. Could have had a great game if you didn't focus on money so much.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999211431,22-Apr-20
Clash of Kings,The fact that you can't go to another app in your phone then turn to the game and it remains functioning is very annoying. I have to restart the game everytime I check something in my phone Edit. I was referring to a matter of seconds if you switch from the game to whatsapp for a couple of seconds the game has to be restarted.. This seems to have been resolved. It would be great if you could review the mail functionality.. there'sa glitch where messages that are read reappear as unread.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999493122,6-Feb-23
Clash of Kings,It's not very good anymore I have not played it in about 5-6 years it was decent I enjoyed the simplicity  but coming back it's a hot mess the graphics are the exact same as before the colours are the same and some mechanics of certain things you want to do is way to complicated and don't know what to do: example - smithing amour you scroll and select ingredients to Smith but this time it's very difficult to understand what to do and the info of that armour just doesn't fit in the little box.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999557793,1-Dec-20
Clash of Kings,Honestly a very fun game. I like the quests and chats in alliance very respectful. Only downside with kingdom sever I am on is that there are many bugs yet to be fixed. It also takes too long to approve a name change. I will say that the gameplay is competitive and easy to level your castle. I would give 4 stars if you fixed the many bugs in the game.,POSITIVE,0,0.981103659,28-Sep-19
Clash of Kings,Trash game doesn't even work ð¤£ I have scouted the alliance fort 12 times but it keeps making me repeat the same quest over and over in the  tutorial  but you can't skip the  tutorial  so I'm permanently stuck in a glitched game that will never progress lmao this game is pure garbage made by garbage developers,NEGATIVE,1,0.999771297,7-Jan-24
Clash of Kings,Love this game but needs to have more detailed info on how everything works other than that a great game overall,NEGATIVE,1,0.99227035,5-Mar-24
Clash of Kings,This game is the best  BEST OF EVERYTHING THAT YOU HATE. All the crashes from time to time - it takes forever to login then when you're in  few sec later it will crash. All the glitches feels like a nightmare. I love this game before  now its screwed up. The pay-to-win part also sucks. This game is stressful already  opposite to what it should seem to be. Then  the worst part is that  the dev always says the will fix and optimize the game but nothing is really happening. DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME,NEGATIVE,1,0.998226702,19-Jul-20
Clash of Kings,Fraud game. They take your money without your authorization then refuse to refund it back. Very poorly run game. With every add on there are three times as many glitches. I warn you not to play this game unless you plan on dumping money into glitches. Also if you play take screen shots of every move you take because if you don't have a screen shot they won't fix a thing. Played many games like this and by far this one has the most issues. Good look,NEGATIVE,1,0.999621391,8-Jan-19
Clash of Kings,This is a honest review from a actual long time player of this game. This game goes down in the history books as being one of the most updated games in the history of all games. It seems like every week it's getting updated. However one of several downsides to each updates is the  absence of the original castle skin menu layout that would not only allow you to choose but to easily pay for your Castle skin of choice or whatever Castle Decoration you wanted. Now all that is gone and not as easy.,POSITIVE,0,0.987201571,30-Aug-23
Clash of Kings,I've actually raised a star and that's for the players and the graphics.They increased events but its still a money game. Some events are  who spends the most   not skill. Recently they did an unannounced action that wiped out all alliance buildings and you had to rebuild. Ok  I understand upgrades  but the wonder(gives bonuses) requires you to rebuild from scratch. It's alot of time and resources.Cok response send a before picture? Seriouslyâ¼If only I could go back in time and save my moneyð¢,NEGATIVE,1,0.923778474,9-Jun-20
Clash of Kings,Hello  I updated my game today and when I went to log in just now my account is gone. Please assist in getting my account back. The issue has not been fixed and this occurred today 12-14-23. It's been fixed. Thanks!,NEGATIVE,1,0.996198952,15-Dec-23
Clash of Kings,What a disaster. This was kind of a ok war game. Lots of different players from around the world. Now it's a highly expensive farm game. If you want to build an expensive farm castle this is the app for you. Killing events have turned into farming events. No more war with one event. Everyone is shielded so no one can have war. This game is absolutely terrible for war game and you better be able to spend over $100k to fight. It's all about money to the developers. Don't bother playing.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994932592,3-Mar-20
Clash of Kings,I have been playing this game or other versions of it for many many years - I think it's been about 5 years. Every time I've played this it has been easy enough to start your own society or alliance. Love the game - is really easy to play at beginning  but the progress slows down a lot after castle level 20ish. I do like how it is really easy to get speed-ups though  and the constant events are all good. There is only one problem  which is why I made this 4 stars instead of 5  is when you are a small alliance  even in a weak kingdom(My alliance is Standard[TTV]) and our alliance power is 90 000 000. Were in kingdom 2048. We started off by making our hive far away from the center  but that got overrun by new castles that came in that had shields. Si we moved close to the center. There was a glitch I kept telling the customer support about  and they did nothing about  to where I can not see our alliance fort or cannon or banners. So it was very tough to move. Now considering were close to the palace  the top alliances {MAX  MVP  FOP  JIB} all attack constantly - and we stand no chance. Moving the hive again would be a hassle and we cant use our alliance cannon because of the problem above. So we just sit and take attacks. Another thing is where it gets really hard to become powerful if you don't spend a lot of money  and how it's impossible to get stronger if there are any stringer people who will just raid you. If you could fix some of these problems it would be great. Another thing us Alliance fort 3 - 40 sciences  is a little too hard to get... I would say 25 or 20 at most would be more reasonable. To fix the problem of people teleporting  attacking  and leaving  you should make it to where they have to wait 5 hours before teleporting again  and cannot use a shield during that time. -Theo p.s THIS GAME IS THE MOST ADDICTIVE GAME - I MEAN IT. IF YOUR RUN AN ALLIANCE ITS SO ADDICTIVE.,POSITIVE,0,0.976293087,11-Jan-20
Age of Origins,Way too much going on  you'd need to be a savant to keep up. 100 different things to keep track of at any one time and thsts just the city building part. The shooting zombie bit is actually the fun part of the game but seems to be the shortest bit. It's pretty much city building and resource management but it's overall complicated by the 100 pop ups.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99662149,23-Apr-24
Age of Origins,I enjoy this game  but there's so much waiting for upgrades and not much actual gameplay. It's designed to frustrate you into spending more money. I don't mind spending some money on games  but the benefit of the money is so small & you need to continually spend more to make it worth it. Fix the balance & it's a 5 star game. Re:dev - events are more of the same. A few tries a day  long refresh times  and more prompts to buy more gold. It's a fun game  but definitely designed to make you spend,POSITIVE,0,0.918991745,8-Apr-24
Age of Origins,The ads showed some sort of first person action sequence. Instead  I was plunked down into a Vampire Survivors knockoff for maybe 20 seconds  then thrown into a base builder that aggressively held my hand until it crashed when I tried to claim a reward. If I got 10 minutes of playtime out of it before it crashed  I'd be surprised. Seems very not good.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999782264,4-Apr-24
Age of Origins,Good game. Keeps me interested. It does glitch a bit. Sometimes the map it the zombie killing stages doesn't show you where the enemies are coming from. It also doesn't want to load fully if you don't actually close the game.. it'll give you a hard to collecting your troops or supplies unless you close the game and reopen it. Other then those minor things it has kept me interested longer them most games do!,POSITIVE,0,0.915955067,19-Feb-24
Age of Origins,Due to updates the game has become unplayable the game crashes on start up  and or crashes when I get to the main screen. I really enjoyed the game but i can't play it now. Even spent money on it. I tried clearing the cache let it re-download all the stuff it needed to run it was crashing in the download. Might come back after the game bugs get fixed. Till then adios,NEGATIVE,1,0.995307982,10-Feb-24
Age of Origins,I like building and growing. It definitely costs money to really get strong and level up in this game. I get tired of building up just to get attacked by same person 10 levels higher 30 times cuz they make their own rules and zero ppls cities. There aren't enough peace shields given. I have 3 farms and still cant keep up  game takes up too much of my time to just constantly be attacked  its not fun anymore. I participate in all events  not enough peace shields given.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998370469,20-Apr-24
Age of Origins,It's somewhat entertaining  but it is 100% geared towards microtransactions/real money purchases. A lot of the challenges and events seem to require a real money purchase to fully complete or be competitive in. It's a standard city builder game with a few mini games that fit the game  but then there's so many other mini games that serve no real purpose but to bleed money from users to actually play or be competitive. Prepare to spend real money or progress slowly and be crushed by whales.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995999813,8-Feb-24
Age of Origins,Very fun at the start. But after playing  the game is a serious cash grab. In order to compete against other players you need to buy upgrades  or else you will wait days on end to farm resources and upgrade without purchasing  only to have a stronger player attack you and a month's worth of playing  waiting  upgrading gone in a flash  literally  so there goes another month to get back to the same position prior. It's fun don't get me wrong  they have a solid game here. Not worth paying a cent..,NEGATIVE,1,0.99059087,12-Mar-24
Age of Origins,Age of Origins is a strategy game that keeps delivering. The combat system is smooth  and the events are always something to look forward to. Iâm hooked on playing Elite Wars every week. Great game!,POSITIVE,0,0.99979192,28-Apr-24
Age of Origins,Total cash grab game. They claim rich rewards if you join events. But the events are an opportunity for you to spend more money to be competitive. Then if you win the rewards aren't even a 1/20 of what you spent. Total money grab!!!!! I only gave a 2 star rating because the game is good and graphics are good. But when it costs over a 100k to get to the top it's terrible.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998152196,17-Apr-24
Age of Origins,This game is NOT as advertised at all  played for a couple hours and never even saw what was advertised. So full of bloat and micro transaction non sense. Mobile games need to get better! This is why I rarely try these games  drop the micro $$$ grab make a game worth paying for.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999288559,21-Apr-24
Age of Origins,COMMERCIALS TOTAL BS! been playing for a year  commercial of the soldiers running down a highway from a zombie hoard while trying to level up players and and weapons DOES NOT EXIST ANYWHERE IN THE GAME! why make that game for a commercial and not provide that game? The tower defense part is great but only 22 levels. Mini games would be fun if you could play them for more then 30 seconds without having to pay cash every time. good game but it's not the game from the Comercial  I want that one,NEGATIVE,1,0.997082889,22-Mar-24
Age of Origins,A lot of random clicking to upgrade your city. Then back to the same fight scenario time and time again. Just all a bit boring really. And nothing like the gameplay depicted on SM adverts. Uninstalled it after a couple of hours. It's a waste of time.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999814808,6-Mar-24
Age of Origins,Just another copy/paste of those  Commander  games. Build and upgrade your city  build and upgrade your army  then go attack other players. Copy paste like the million other games just like it  but with a zombie theme. The Zombie survivor thing is just a mini game. Fun  reminds me a lot of  Not Another Zombie Survivor  on Steam  just way more simple and short.,POSITIVE,0,0.925645709,31-Mar-24
Age of Origins,Nonsense. Nothing like the ad shown. It's a high quality remake of this another game where you collect XP and upgrade weapons through different maps. I forgot the name... Skip and save your time if you are thinking this is the same game you saw in the ad.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999144077,26-Feb-24
Age of Origins,I really enjoy this game so far! There aren't extreme limitations in the Story Mode that would require investing financially. Also  after level 7 you can log in two or three times in a day and make great progress on researching  building  recruiting and exploring 2-3 hour blocks at a time without using speed ups. I recommend building and upgrading your farm and oil fields as quickly as possible. That way that are consistently bringing in a larger quantity of crops and oil over time.,POSITIVE,0,0.999122441,18-Feb-24
Age of Origins,It's a decent game  however; I can't tell you the number of times I've worked on one map. Hundreds. All because you can't really choose what you level up. I'm about to delete the app just because you can't strategically level up. Instead the game loves to get you to increase new and weaker weapons before getting to upgrade the primary weapon. It makes me question even spending money on the game. What's the point in paying to win if you can't even upgrade the weapons you need to pass a lvl?,NEGATIVE,1,0.928246796,5-Feb-24
Age of Origins,Too many micro transactions needed to make game level up to not get obliterated by other players. It's not the game advertised  it's like 4 games thrown together to cause you to spend money if you want to continue through the game you like because you have to level up which takes forever unless you spend more money,NEGATIVE,1,0.998521626,24-Mar-24
Age of Origins,I do not want to spend an hour being forced to read through nonsense and only be allowed to click specific pop-ups. I want to explore the game not chase down a bunch of hand icons telling me where to press next. It specifically prevents you from tapping anywhere else on the screen.,NEGATIVE,1,0.912345707,1-Feb-24
Age of Origins,Requires excessive permissions like access to your photos and phone status. Creepy. They say it's to guard your info if you lose your device  but plenty of games just do it through your Google account without having access to all your private files.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997252762,18-Apr-24
Age of Origins,This game is horrible  nothing like the ads. It's full of oversexualised characters and there's nothing like the ads except for the first bit of the game  I don't even know why they are trying to advertise this when the game is bad in general  make the games like the ads and we will actually download it and play it. This company sucks and the game too. I hope CamelStudios never makes games again.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999693394,12-Apr-24
Age of Origins,Guides along at start; but no instruction/tips for most. Fun army builder  gathering  but too much pay-2-play req'd. 2+builders req'd but only 1 is free. Too much page clicking to do daily list  gather  claim  recruit  etc  &always need to swap base to map; it needs THE 1 button on ev page to do all. Any1 any level can plunder you w/ no recourse. Resources waiting grow absurdly. Glorify refuG but Can't send unlimited to help others  but can make your own other Alliance to pillage  tarded.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998850822,14-Apr-24
Age of Origins,Why are you requiring access to photos and video? Seems unnecessary and I'm uninstalling.. Edit: that's the wrong type of permission to store your game. You would need storage permission for that  not for photos and video. It's literally different in the manifest. Do not trust these app developers  this is incredibly dodgy.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999586046,6-Apr-24
Age of Origins,My original review was deleted after the people in charge responded to it for..well it wasn't a glowing testimony  so I can see why. Unethical nonetheless. OG comment was it quickly becomes a pay-to-play game. It's also mischievously placed the 'buy' button exactly where your thumb would hand after selecting regular in-game options. Which is straight up an attempt to get money non-consensually. They replied (paraphrasing):  ...events..(equals)..better rewards..  Terrible defense/buis. Model.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999269307,10-Apr-24

Age of Origins,10 minutes into the game asks me to agree to provide my entire dossier of private information in order to continue playing. When I rejected it  it automatically closed the game. Simple solution I guess. I'll uninstall it and rate it 1 star. Too much upgrading city stuff  not enough gameplay anyways,NEGATIVE,1,0.999254167,3-Feb-24
Age of Origins,This game has a lot of depth to each system in the game  and the game includes multiple avenues of play  which keeps things fresh. You can play a top down arcade shooter  a dungeon runner  a citysimulator  or conquest a risk like map in a multi-player battle for territory. All game modes contribute to the same in game leveling system and each mode has an available upgrade system.,POSITIVE,0,0.999471128,26-Feb-24
Age of Origins,Fun but very difficult to advance after level 14 when you don't pay. I keep building up my resources for days  even a week at a time then I get invaded and robbed.

Age of Origins,I have played this game for 3 years the idea is good and I have made some good friends along the way but I would only recommend starting the game if you willing to spend money otherwise you will be left far behind the others who do......... I would give a more favourable review if improvements are made I have spent alot of money on this game and time I think it's fair to warn others that money is essential in this game if you don't spend you will struggle to grow,NEGATIVE,1,0.970630348,13-Feb-24
Age of Origins,I think something of the latest event is causing the game to crash. I can't get it to stay open. Down to one star for ads not properly representing the game at all. I suspect the ads were early prototypes.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999795258,6-Mar-24
Age of Origins,I really wish you guys would go back and fill empty nations before making new ones. Our nation (1035) could use some help. I have also contacted customer service a week ago.

Age of Origins,This game will allow up to certain point when you are comfortable playing but if you are not buying different packages will block your account mentioning some kind of wrong doing flagged by system. You'll no longer have account access so you have to restart from new game and will lost all the progress you made. Months of work will be vain unless you are paying here and there.

I've downloaded discord but have no clue how to post a thing or talk to other players for help Sun May28th PST  the game won't open and it's the KE right now! Help!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999385238,20-Mar-24
Age of Origins,The game won't even load on mobile data. I've cleared the cache  reinstalled the game  checked all my settings and it's only AOO that doesn't work so I doubt it's my phone. HT-005 Error. The options are to  try again  (doesn't work) or  contact us  but I can't get the information needed to fill in the form because the game won't load. ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.999564588,18-Mar-24
Age of Origins,Y'all fckd up the spur of the moment update again. Uninstalled and reinstalled and still stuck on the  logging in  screen... And I see as usual  you blame the device. The problem is your update  not my network and not my device. You know this but are just trying to save face publicly. Just a shameful display by SCAMel. Shame on you!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999398351,25-Mar-24
Age of Origins,When it simply boils down  the game play they show in the ad never happens in the game. There is some gameplay that is similar to it  but still not exactly what is shown in the ad  and it is short. In order to play that gameplay  you have to progress through building a city  which is very very complicated  and you often just click on blue circles not really knowing what you're doing. It's very bloated  and very misleading marketing showing a game that actually looks really fun  but doesn't exist,NEGATIVE,1,0.999315858,12-Jan-24
Age of Origins,There's simply too much of everything. Too many events  too many mini games  too many mechanics for fighting and growing. It's like a yard sale that becomes the size of 3. city blocks. Progressing your city requires many more resources than I've seen in any other game like this  and makes it nearly impossible to play without spending a lot  having farm accounts  and/or buying from the many resource traders who've turned the game into an occupation. Basically bloated and frustrating.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999767125,1-Jan-24
Age of Origins,Just another P2W!!! Base building game. The main zombie killing bit is fun but takes ages to level up characters. If you're F2P & don't wanna keep playing the same levels repeatedly  Don't bother even installing this game at all,NEGATIVE,1,0.997144878,12-Apr-24
Age of Origins,â¢The graphic is good  but it needs to be upgraded more. â¢Nice modelling. â¢Good quality for both Genre's. â¢Good quality for gameplay heroes and cities. â¢overall it needs to be upgraded into much better quality and graphics.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997685194,2-Apr-24
Age of Origins,Absolutely horrible company. They can and will simply erase purchased items from your in-game inventory whenever they feel like. There is no recourse and nothing you can do. This is a pay to win game - those who spend $100 000 USD win  it's that simple.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998587489,21-Apr-24
Age of Origins,It could do better with the user interface. The time limits could be shorter than an HR real time but overall just like the other build and defense games.,POSITIVE,0,0.969995677,19-Mar-24
Age of Origins,Its an o.k. game. The game play is kind of ruined because every time you turn around you have to purchase gold or other items  the game is limited on growth due to having to be in an alliance or features being unlocked at certain levels or having to participate in events to obtain certain items  and events are on a time schedule. There are many pluses on the game as well as negatives. Persuading you to make a purchase every time you turn around or click on something is definitely a negative.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999818027,26-Jan-24
Age of Origins,The games can be fun to play if you start off in a new world.. some of the nations are filled with nothing but bullies who literally force people just joining or who don't spend out of the game because they've spent 100s 1000s even 100 000s of dollars in the game upgrading all of their stuff. Rules that are not actual game rules but made up rules by  leaders  of the alliances also make it a lot less fun because if you do spend money you have these dictators telling you how you will play or else,NEGATIVE,1,0.992052794,23-Apr-24
Age of Origins,As many have described  game is fun at the beginning but there's so many old players in the game that they're level 40 plus and they hit your city day in and day out. You can't grow unless you spend AAA title money on this game. Also  within the game there's buying and selling of accounts. Most players have farm accounts which are just numerous other accounts. They team up on all the little guys and you have no chance of ever beating them. Don't waste your money.,NEGATIVE,1,0.931151509,2-Apr-24
Age of Origins,Age of Origins has become my daily dose of strategy and excitement. The Chaosland event is the icing on the cake. I can't recommend this game enough!,POSITIVE,0,0.998751163,29-Apr-24
Age of Origins,I have amended the review however the biggest issue I have now is  there's a bug with the bug reporting. The game asks for permission to access to photos and camera of which I have granted it but it still asks to grant it access. An HT-004 ERROR has left me unable to login for the last 24hrs. I have made multiple attempts to report the issue to no avail due to the aforementioned bug. Reinstalling requires you to go through the tutorial  approx. 30mins unskippable even with an existing account.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998462796,10-Dec-23
Age of Origins,Like the greedy gaming compies that exist starts off the first 8 levels are great then it hits. Forced pay to play and definitely nothing worth investing a cent in. Better off in my pocket then yours. It shows how greedy gaming companies are and it is pathetic. Though gaming was suppose to be fun and entertaining. Nothing fun or entertaining about this game anymore.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999570191,26-Feb-24
Age of Origins,Loving it.......for now After 4 years of playing  I came to realise this game is all about spending your money. Ridiculous items for high prize  there's always new items to purchase. You can't compete in this game without spending a lot of money,POSITIVE,0,0.975872517,13-Mar-24
Age of Origins,Very well done but overly monetized. If they did an introduction version then asked you to buy the game instead of asking for $5-$10 for every little thing this would be a great game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.977876306,28-Feb-24
Age of Origins,This is a strategic farm game that is pay to play. 1st off you need to start a metric button ton of accounts to use as your farming accounts and then designated a couple of account for pushing development. It far to boring and way to corrupt of game model with multiple accounts and robot account all over. STAY AWAY!,NEGATIVE,1,0.998347402,25-Mar-24
Age of Origins,I enjoy the killing of zombies and the general map experience are truly enjoy. The the challenge that's really fun being able to fight zombies and change up your soldiers  your elite warriors and it's really fun,POSITIVE,0,0.999878407,17-Mar-24
Age of Origins,The most paid win game on the market everything comes in a very stingy amount with an exceptionally large price tag if you are free to play person about $100 worth of items will take you about 3 months Don't download it it's not worth it if you end up liking it it will probably ruin your life and your bank account The game has so much potential but you can tell it's main goat is to be a money machine That's why there's about 10 games with this exact blueprint just exchange zombies for kights,NEGATIVE,1,0.998942792,29-Mar-24
Age of Origins,Absolutely addicting. Super in depth. One of my new favorite games! Edit: MANNNN YOU GOTTA SPEND MONEY TO ACTUALLY GO FAR AND GET STRONG IN THIS GAME. YOU GRIND FOR HOURS AT A TIME  IT CONSUMES YOUR ENTIRE LIFE AND YOU STILL CANT BEAT ALL THE BIG SPENDERS LIVING IN THEIR PARENTS BASEMENTS AT 36 WITH DADDYS DEBIT CARD. STILL HELLA FUN BUT BALANCE THE DAMN GAME.,POSITIVE,0,0.994757175,27-Mar-24
Age of Origins,Devs couldn't even get the hand to load at the correct orientation. It's upside down. Clunky  awful controls on top of that. Plays nothing like ads. 0 Star garbage.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999675751,10-Mar-24
Age of Origins,At first the game wasn't making sense to me. But its kinda like doomday last surviors( sorry if i misspelled it) but my only issue is its super hard to find anything to lvl up your heros so maybe make it a little easier.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999232292,25-Apr-24
Age of Origins,im playing this game and i love it . but the only problem is this hlgame there are to many autobots cheat player who sells resources mostly they are stupid vietnamess who ruined the game im hoping you guys developer fixes this and banned those vietnamess using cheats auto farm auto city upgrade auto attack and many more . its really so annoying ruined the game,NEGATIVE,1,0.999697328,25-Apr-24

Age of Origins,I actually enjoy this a bit. I have not spent one $ so the grind is slow but if I just want to lay waste to zombies for 5 minutes it'd there.,NEGATIVE,1,0.685668766,26-Apr-24
Age of Origins,Pretty cool so far  just wish it didn't take so long to get new characters and upgrades  then I would buy something and become more invested in the game,POSITIVE,0,0.974589407,26-Apr-24

Age of Origins,Only been playing a week and enjoy the game. Is there a place in game that I can look up things to help me like a help manual. Also what purpose does the power ore serve? What is it used for?,POSITIVE,0,0.701179981,27-Apr-24
Age of Origins,What's going on ?  I m not able to open the app.... I even uninstalled the app and installed again  but still  not able to open. Game stuck at loading and initating 0/100%,NEGATIVE,1,0.999654531,21-Apr-24
Age of Origins,You Need to offer more speed perks for free or more battles in the city without having to pay  it does take the fun out of the game needing to always wait for upgrades & level ups.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995647252,19-Apr-24
Age of Origins,Nothing like the ads. Came here for the first person shooter with zombies. Got stuck building and spending$$ to play SIMCity. Uninstalled in five minutes..,NEGATIVE,1,0.999276459,6-Apr-24

Age of Origins,Very beautiful game but I don't know what to do it's so many options and centers everything is just to much all I wanted was to hit Zs make cash and upgrade weapons but I got a whole city to fix and to upgrade it's to much for me but it's cool,POSITIVE,0,0.998929322,27-Mar-24
Age of Origins,Lots of mini game . So can switch from main game play. Scaling is ok. Not many forced pay to play â¤ï¸,POSITIVE,0,0.998455644,28-Apr-24
Age of Origins,The experience has been an utter disappointment to be totally honest  the customer support service is abysmal  you get no help. The game lag is terrible during events  even things like infinite zombies  the mini game  lags  it's ridiculous given the amount of money myself and my teammates have spent on this game  along with the many people in other nations  who are having the same issues  and getting zero help. CAMEL NEEDS TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS  OR THEY WILL CONTINUE TO SEE $0.00s.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999764979,6-Mar-24
Age of Origins,Terrible  Pay2Win game. In-game community is Toxic. Nothing is done to fix real issues. Pay-to-Win strategy is the real major issue followed by Nation(server) rules that destroy the game. No real counter to bully alliances and self-nation(server) Rules that destroy gameplay. Cross nation competitions like Void or Frenzy destroy sense of unity and the game community shuns and destroys you if you don't spend thousands of real money to be worth it. It's not a fun game to play  due to pay2win.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999818861,12-Feb-24
Age of Origins,The game is good but sin in options are crazy. Recovering an account is really difficult  and it's really easy to make a mistake which will cause loosing it,NEGATIVE,1,0.997003734,5-Feb-24
Age of Origins,Its very fun. U will have to spend alittle or gotta wait to upgrade everything. buts thats like most games now days. Enjoy it alot.,POSITIVE,0,0.999371588,27-Apr-24
Age of Origins,It's crazy how developers lost all shame. It's a good game  but absolute money grab Only pay to play... not even win.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996162176,21-Apr-24
Age of Origins,Not free to play friendly at all man. I decided to finally play this game after seeing a Facebook ad for the 1000th time and guess what? I never seen that gameplay from the ad in the game. For events you have to spend real money to complete any of them. Packs are expensive and not worth it. The game needs an overall overhaul to make any sense. I get it being a cash grab but make the game better at least. It you decide to play the game from seeing the ad please read reviews first.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999280274,31-Jan-24
Age of Origins,It was a fun game at first.. Uranium is the money maker on this game. It freezes  lags  n restart all the time.. not worth it. I only play because I started 4 yrs ago n didn't spend money.. my city after 4 yrs is c34,NEGATIVE,1,0.989158809,23-Feb-24
Age of Origins,The game is addictive and fun. Only disappointment is the fact you can't change servers after level 8. Once you realize you are stuck with a bunch of petty adult brats as you level up  you are stuck in that one server forever. People can't enjoy the game longer when the aforementioned petty adults who buy packs to get stronger will keep invading your city and stealing your rss  which makes upgrading the city impossibly slow. Don't waste any money on this game. Been playing for almost 2 years.,NEGATIVE,1,0.813818097,22-Dec-23
Age of Origins,Extremely pay to win. Scummy microtransaction practices. Will release free item reward codes on holidays that only have a limited number of uses  it's always released at 3-4am USA time so no one here ever gets to use the code because it gets used up within 1 hour. Merry Christmas! Game is buggy and often needs to be restarted to fix annoying glitches that prevent the game from running properly.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999396443,25-Dec-23
Age of Origins,I downloaded it   to do the commercial. Billion zombies on bridge and u have to shoot power up etc . I've got 10 hours n and yet to play it. Nothing what they advertise,NEGATIVE,1,0.999628901,21-Apr-24
Age of Origins,Game is not anything like what is shown on advertisements. Game deleted in all incorrect advertisements reported. Will continue to report all false advertisements in future. Don't act like the ads your not subject to your oversight before they are displayed.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998939812,6-Apr-24

Age of Origins,Omg this game is terrible. I just want to shoot the zombies why the hell am I having to click literally 45 times on a city in order to go to the next level. What a fail of a game,NEGATIVE,1,0.999780595,2-Apr-24
Age of Origins,Game play is nothing like any of the adverts which is a total disappointment. But also I feel like its just a bit devious of the developers.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996088028,13-Apr-24
Age of Origins,Solid graphics and game play  some of their bundles and items for purchase are extremely overpriced and doesn't make any sense for the price u pay vs what you get. A good example is the lucky stolen treasure event  if I spend $5 in return I get 5 random items that are usually worth $1.in other packages. Think they need to re-evaluation some of their packages and purchase events.. Y'all getting outta control with ur uranium prices  idk if u guys heard but inflation is coming back down smh,NEGATIVE,1,0.999464452,14-Jan-24
Age of Origins,It's a cool game  but after a while. The players were hired by the power began to try to monopolize the game and it turns into tyranny and bullying.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997985005,5-Apr-24

Age of Origins,Good game but like all the others of its ilk its mostly cash grabs to lvl your stuff  you don't have to but won't make it far without spending some money.,POSITIVE,0,0.990388215,1-Apr-24
Age of Origins,I have wasted over a years worth of my time trying to get to the part of the game that you see advertised. IT DOESN'T EXSIST. This is a clear case of false advertisement! The reason I downloaded this game is because the ad I viewed looked fun. I did not have fun because the clip in the ad is fake!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999594986,29-Jan-24
Age of Origins,So far it is very fun. A different type of strategy game on the phone with action strategy combined with missions. Easy to learn easy to kill time with. One issue so far is when you join alliance you can't click on members location but have to go to map and search. Would be nice if a quick longitude latitude click and see where they are. Other than that so far one of my favorites.,POSITIVE,0,0.99886322,23-Nov-23
Age of Origins,Great experience. Love all the rewards they give you through the story mode and the plot of the game thickens with each progression.,POSITIVE,0,0.999863982,8-Feb-24

Age of Origins,This game used to be fun to play but they changed it and now it sucks. Stronger alliances attack weaker alliances preventing them from growing. They do annoying repetitive attacks and enforce their own rules and imitate other players to follow them.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999221802,30-Mar-24
Age of Origins,This is not what is advertised. The systems are never really explained and are overly complicated. The game play is incredibly one note. Certainly not what I expected.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999688745,3-Feb-24

Age of Origins,Terrible. Doesn't play at all like the ads. Deceptive advertising. Actual scam. The developer claims that it's ok because the ads are made by an agency. This is not a valid excuse.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998541594,10-Mar-24
Age of Origins,First of all not what advertised. There is no game actually  the idea behind it is to put a bunch of minigames into single Frankenstein app where you have to tap something each 10 minutes,NEGATIVE,1,0.999488831,29-Mar-24
Age of Origins,I will delete this silly game because they show something in the advertisment and surprise you with a whole different thing after downloading the game!  this is a fraud!.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996853888,23-Mar-24

Red Ball 4,My kids used to play this game all the time and I would always watch them. One day I got curious and decided to try it myself. I was sent in the site they played it on and it was called  coolmath  you should totally check it out. Anyways So I clicked the game and I was up and running. I finished all the levels without losing any lives! (I'm that awsome not bragging though) So my kids were mad at me and I felt bad because I knew they really loved the game. So after that they were really mad and wanted to finish all the levels themselves. So o they searched up the game and a ton of websites popped up saying red ball. My kids ammediatly just picked a random ones and they started playing. While they were doing that I was sitting on the computer scrolling through the games and I was curious what my kids were doing. So I went and saw a them in some website on my phone and they wouldn't t let me see the phone because what I did earlier. But I snatched the phone anyways. I found the website they were playing on caused viruses and had inappropriate games and shooting games. I ammedialty removed that from my search history and told my kids they aren't allowed to go on it ever again they nodded but pouted when they did it. I felt bad so I went on the app store to see if red ball was an app. It was so I downloaded it and my kids were all excited! I thought that was all done!! UNTIL.... One week later my kids come to me moaning that they keep running out of lifes quickly and that ads pop up. I decided to check the app out myself. Well.. Thus jump button barely made red ball jump and my kids couldn't even get past level three! Ads kept popping up and I lost my interest. I told them I had too delete the app and they started crying. Now that I saw this experience with red ball I told my kids they are not allowed to play this game. Thanks a lot red ball 4 developer! Everyday I hafta deal with 2 unhappy kids!!,POSITIVE,0,0.629895091,2-Jul-17

Red Ball 4,I used to play this game all the time when I was younger so I came to play this game again recently. And it has been really fun and harder than you would expect. But you have a max of five lives and if you lose them all you either have to wait 20 minutes or pay a dollar. Which isn't much and I think is fair but if you short on money or just didn't want to spend any on a mobile game. So that can result into you waiting 20 minutes for ONE life and instantly lose it on a difficult obstacle then have to wait another 20 minutes just for another CHANCE. Dispute everything I said I still love this game. (P.S I don't think I made it clear but once you pay a dollar you will have unlimited lives  no ads  and can play any level. So it isn't like one dollar for one life or anything.),NEGATIVE,1,0.996676207,17-Feb-24
Red Ball 4,I recently started playing this game.  It's easy to get the hang of it  but difficult to master.  You have to wait a short while after you lost three lives  but the game regenerates your lives fairly quickly.  The game runs smoothly on my Fire tablet.,POSITIVE,0,0.997515321,4-Apr-24

Stumble Guys,This game is one of the most popular online games as of writing  and after I played it  I can easily see why. When I first heard about this game  I was on the school bus  and my first reaction was   You seriously play this? It's just a ripoff of Fall Guys. But after I played it  I was pleasantly surprised. When I finally caved and downloaded the game  I was expecting a crappy mobile game that the developers had put no effort in. But after playing the game for a while  I was like    Damn  this is actually good! . The gameplay is very much cut from the same  cloth as Fall Guys  but it's main pro over Fall Guys is that it's on virtually every mobile device. Meanwhile Fall Guys is still only on Steam and maybe some consoles (I don't know if It's on PS4  PS5  Xbox One  Xbox Series X\S  Nintendo Switch  all  or neither.)  The game runs fairly smoothly  which was one of my main concerns since my Kindle can barely run Roblox (Keep in mind it's about 3/4 years old.)  but the game runs really smoothly. It also gets constant updates  and has collabed with Nerf  He-Man  Spongebob  and MrBeast. My only complaint is that I don't know how to play Nerd mode. If anyone knows how  please respond to me. Overall  I would definitely recommend this game! PS: As of writing  my username is Wisehome1.,POSITIVE,0,0.880438566,10-Mar-24

June's Journey - Hidden Object Mystery,I've been playing this game for about 6 months  and it's very enjoyable! The storyline is interesting  and I still haven't managed to make it to the end of the game  even after a LOT of playtime. The game puts out side stories every so often that can be played separately for a limited time and earn extra rewards. You can play this game without spending money  and the energy you need to play refills atW a pretty good rate every 24 hours  and if you also play the side stories  you can earn enough energy to play a good chunk of the main storyline. I have definitely ended up spending money on the game to play more  though  as the game is quite fun and relaxing. I recommend joining a  club  to play more of the side things and exchange drinks for bonus energy  etc. The gameplay is this: in each level you search an image for specific objects. The scenes get more cluttered with objects over time  and you score better the faster you find the objects.,POSITIVE,0,0.998669267,7-Dec-23
June's Journey - Hidden Object Mystery,This is a fun game. I truly enjoy playing it daily. It is helpful with my memory and passes time with something cute. The story is really cute too. I usually skip through these stories but with this game I stop to read the story. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for some fun.,POSITIVE,0,0.999289274,23-Mar-24
June's Journey - Hidden Object Mystery,"This was one of the best games I've played on my Kindle Fire. It has an engaging story. The graphics are superb. The options for building your own mansion  estate  town  and environment are a delight. You can personalize the game in many ways so your game feels like it's really your own  perfect home by the sea.

One of the best things is how low-stress the actual game is. Most objects aren't very hidden. They don't change places between levels  either. Also  this is a superb game to improve your memory skills  without worrying you'll run out of time before solving the mystery.

So  why did I rate this one-star...?

It's not because some of the words (in English) were wrong for the item. In close to 90 levels I played - I think that happened only four or five times.

I was okay with the regional vocabulary issues  too. For example  what I'd call a bag (like a grocery bag)... it was a  sack  in the game. And what I'd call a purse... it was a  bag  on the same screen as the  sack.  That can be confusing when you're looking for a slightly hidden object  but - for me - it's a minor issue.

The reason I stopped playing - and I'm giving this game one star - was Wooga GmbH's customer service. It's terrible. It's easily among the worst I've encountered among gaming companies.

Here's what happened  so you can judge for yourself:

Part of the game includes using your coins (which you earn  free  or purchase with cash) to buy items to add to your landscape. Those landscape items could be anything from a hedge to a conservatory  or something entirely decorative.

Some of those are limited-time  themed items  like a tennis court offered during three  summer camp  weeks. (You can only buy those items during the event. You still keep them after the event is over  but you can't buy more of them  later.)

And  when you buy a certain number of those limited-time items - which can take minutes or days to be constructed (virtually) for use in the game - you earn a special reward. It's a decoration that can't be purchased  only won.

So far  so good.

The problem was when - two days before the event concluded - I was five points short of the reward. (I think the reward threshold was 3000 in points  or something like that.) Though I could have bought a smaller item  I decided on I something that added over a hundred points to my score. That put me far above the threshold for the reward.

But then  after that purchase  I didn't receive the reward. That was a surprise.

 Okay   I thought.  Maybe it's because the item needs three days to be constructed  and the challenge is over in two days. 

So  the next day  I bought (with game coins) a smaller item that would mature within the time limit. And I continued playing  content that I'd soon receive the event reward.

The smaller item was fully constructed overnight. In the morning  it was ready for me  with a nice red ribbon to untie  which I did... but the reward still didn't show up.

After about half an hour  searching the game's FAQs  I discovered that - to qualify for each limited-time reward - the item (1) has to be purchased  and (2) has to be constructed within the time the reward is available  AND (3) you have to untie the ribbon on that item. Otherwise... no reward.

Before my lengthy search of the FAQs  that information was never displayed to me. There's no formal tutorial presentation in the game. It's fairly intuitive. But it seems silly to expect players to comb through FAQs for fine print that so significantly affects game play.

So  I contacted June's Journey support  explaining what had happened. I didn't really expect them to give me the reward I thought I'd earned  but I did expect a dialogue about more accessible information for players.

Instead  the tone of the reply was   Too bad. You didn't read the fine print.  (I think it was a form letter. Not the most sympathetic phrasing I've ever seen.)

When I wrote back  explaining how upset I was  I still expected a dialogue of some kind. Other games are fairly straightforward with details players need to know  to get the most enjoyment from the game. How could such a great game  like June's Journey  fall so far short on this one issue...?

Again  I received the equivalent of a shrug  as if my concerns didn't matter. And I guess they didn't.

I look back on how much actual cash I spent on June's Journey  and that's annoying. I'm far more upset because - up to that point - I thought it was the very best game available. I looked forward to playing it  daily.

I was heartbroken as I deleted the game from my Kindle Fire. (Today  I reinstalled it to be able to write this review  so it shows up as a game I've actually had experience with. The pangs I felt  seeing the Wooga screen... ouch.)

Having played many games on my Kindle Fire over the past couple of years  I'm astonished that some of the best games have the worst customer service. And games that are weak in other areas seem to offer the most thoughtful and personal customer support.

I still think the concept of June's Journey could make it one of the best games at any price  even if it was around $50. However  I can't recommend it because I have no idea how many other  gotcha  rules are hidden in their FAQs. For me  it just took one - and then terrible communications from their support staff - to quit playing June's Journey. (This same company - Wooga GmbH - also produces  Pearl's Peril   which I have not played.)

I'm giving it one star so others are warned about the hidden rules that spoil this game.",POSITIVE,0,0.999723256,12-Aug-20
June's Journey - Hidden Object Mystery,I've been playing almost since the game started. I love the storyline  building and developing islands  coffee hour and club mysteries. However  I find many of the extras to be money grabs. Memories album for one. No matter how much you play  if you don't actually spend money on packs  you'll never get to the second perk. And the  deja vus  are useless unless you accumulate a lot of them. All in all its a decent game  it would be a great one if they weren't so expensive to play.,POSITIVE,0,0.882533789,1-Mar-24
June's Journey - Hidden Object Mystery,I really enjoy playing this game  until I am forced to get an energy reduction  reset Help Wanted or do anything that sends you to an Ad. Some of the shorter Ads work ok  but the multiscreen long Ads (particularly those advertising another game) are disastrous. Yesterday it crashed no fewer than 6 times. To add insult to injury  the same ad appeared every time. So  it crashes  you wait to reload and then it crashes again & again. Chatting with support is a waste of time as in most instances  it's days before you hear back. Doing anything that requires a short time interval is useless when you can't rely on an Ad to close properly. Then there's the issue where you get sent to the page to install the game they're advertising with no way to close and safely return to your game. It's so frustrating when most of the other elements are decent. I say most because they have developed some new  side  games that are basically unplayable within the time alloted  like the Secrets Game and this other crazy new concept of playing a club game where you try to solve a multi level puzzle in 30 minutes. The rules are convoluted and after playing 2x  I'm done.  The graphics are good. The beautifications are fun  so there are aspects of the game that I really enjoy. But  the downsides make me crazy.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999687195,31-Jul-23

However  I have lost more then 20 diamonds because my next surveys froze before I could collect the diamonds I was already awarded for previous surveys. So its a great idea but sometimes its frustrating because my surveys keep freezing  then I'm unable to collect the diamonds I was awarded.

Also  I'm wondering if I'm at the end of the line in my game because I have purchased all of the buildings that collect coins. I don't see any more of these bldgs. available. Also  I'm having a difficult time getting enough flowers to open the next chapter. 99 percent of my bldgs. have been upgraded already.

Training  breeding  building  it all takes around 23 hours to finish  and the only way to get them to speed up is either watch an add  which half the time doesn't work  or spend your life savings in gems  which are extremely hard to get.

I've opened tons of packs of card's only to receive food coins or common dinos (which is beyond lame).. Everything you do in this game takes 45min to 7 days ie building anything  making hybrids  just basically everything.On battle level16 you hit a brick wall and do nothing but waste money for day's straight... If you're thinking I'll get this free game and that's it ..THINK AGAIN!! THIS IS A PAY TO WIN GAME!!!! if you don't intend on buying packs ect this definitely isn't the game for you the cost of doing anything in this game just drains you...Definitely not fun after level10 everything just becomes a hassle after that..What they don't tell you(when purchasing the VIP package) is you have to be lvl50 to use alot of VIP features also it gives you a T Rex but you can't level it up till lvl54 of the game(unless you spend real cash to buy packs or pay the 49.99  at last check to get it unlocked  so it's absolutely pointless to have it before lvl50.Whoever the mathematician is that oversaw the whole 10+10=11 is just comical this game is nothing more than a scam show disguised as a game..... Definitely wouldn't recommend!!

Edit: I have officially deleted the game and forfeited(taken the loss)on the vip/and card packs purchased @level41 you have to have 100 dinosaurs  I have23 and don't even really have access to that many so I'm just taking the loss and admitting I've been defeated by this scam show...

Also it really teaches you about what dinosaurs were like with the facts you get when you upgrade a dinosaur and the minigames also help you with patience  and paying attention. But also there are a few glitches and flaws with this game  here is a list of some of the flaws.
1.The one minigame where you have to pay attention to the bar and if it is touching another bar is good and all. but in my opinion  The bar is way too fast and this makes the game way too hard.
2.There is a glitch where it won't load the game even if you have internet.
3.Too much things have to be bought with REAL money.
3(2).EVERYTHING HAS TOO MUCH OF A BIG PRICE!
4.A lot of the times  when you're (Evolving/Hatching/Retrieving escaped) Dinos  it takes too much of a long time. By the time the timer is done  The player will most likely be done playing or his/her day will have ended!

They do have VIP pack for $99 for a year !
That's seems to be a great deal - enjoy many many perks for a less than $10 a year !

App tells you that payment did not go through   but you will see in your bank statement   that each and every time you got charged !!!
And it's impossible to get dissent help at Amazon .
I got charged 3 times for VIP pack   and I still have none in game week later !

Snake.io - Fun Snake .io Games,"Great game  helps pass time  but if you get angry at things easily  I'm warning you now DO NOT play this game. Otherwise its great!

How to play:

First of all  those little dots on the map are good  don't avoid them. They help you get longer  wider  and bigger in general.
To kill someone  make them crash into your snake and then collect their  remains . That will help you get bigger too.
But the thing is  they can do the same to you. So watch out for that. But if you do die  don't worry because you can almost always revive!
Also  if you come across th border  DONT touch it. It kills you. But like I said earlier  you can almost always revive.
Tips:
-if you are super long  I recommend trapping others as you form a loop and slowly make the space smaller to kill them.
-if there is someone right next to you  trying to kill you  do a random swirve towards them and kill them.
-only use speed boost when needed  otherwise  if you don't notice at the beginning  you lose most of your   body .

1. There's a bug in where you turn invisible when you get too close to the edge of the map sometimes and I really do not like that. Being invisible is harder and it makes me get killed easier. Please fix this and remove it.

2. There's another glitch in where sometimes when I get the pump it lasts forever and I cannot move and I have to restart the game because I cannot go back to the menu! Please fix this developers.

3. It killed me when I was at 83% and I was so mad and I was trying to get to 100%. Fix this please to make it more possible to get 100%.

4. It did not save my progress sometimes and I has to do all of that again just for it to say that I got 30%. Please fix this please.

Conquer Your Area,I got this app to play against real people. When it installed  I saw that every other game  THERE WAS AN AD. And when I started playing the game  the other people are all BOTS. There was a bunch of stupid little power-ups scattered throughout the map  that you had to watch an ad (mid-game!!) for a one-time use. The bots also seemed to be faster than me  and the app always after every game  bribes me with this VIP subscription that you have to pay like TEN DOLLARS A MONTH for!!!! Once  when I was playing a certain gamw  I FINALLY became king (the person (or bot) with the biggest area) and I got this one powerful that doesn't require you to watch ad  (it makes your area bigger) and it CRASHED!!!!!

Crossword Jam,This game shows false advertisement! Have you seen the advertisement for this game?! It shows a person doing a crossword and it gives you sentences  then you have to spell the word on the grid  and it shows you if it's right. For example  the sentence could say: Are you smarter ________ a fifth grader? It would give you the options ''than'' and ''then''. Then on the grid on the very bottom of your screen  you had to spell it right  and then you beat a level. Are you kidding me? This game is nothing like that advertisement!! This game is basically just a clear copy of WordScapes!! I got this game just to sharpen my brain like the advertisement stated. One other thing about this game  it's not really about spelling. You just have to type the word  it fixes it for you if you spell it wrong  anyway. It's just for figuring out words. One very last thing  merry Christmas! Hope you get - and give - some amazing gifts this year!! *Don't let parents read this part* Kids  if your parents are really nice and kind to you  why don't you show it?

One Clue Crossword : 100s of great free crosswords with picture clues!,I will start off by saying this is a very fun game.  It is free  which is great.  It downloaded and installed onto my Kindle Fire with absolutely no problems.  It opens with no problems and I have yet to experience any sort of glitch.Some of the puzzles are easy and take me less than a minute.  Some of them are a much greater challenge for me.  There are stickers to collect and  when you collect all the stickers in a group  you collect a tokens reward.  There is a crossword puzzle to solve at the end of each level and there is a word of the day to solve.I really enjoyed it until I made it to level 3 and began encountering numerous messages that I do not have enough tokens to play a certain puzzle.  The only ways to get enough tokens once that happens is to buy more tokens  which I am not going to do  keep trying until you get the option of watching a video for 5 tokens or you get the option to watch a video and then be allowed to play that puzzle.  If I only get the videos for tokens option  I typically have to keep trying to get that option so I may have to watch as many as 5 videos just to earn enough tokens to play a single puzzle and then go through it all again for the next puzzle.If it was not for this  I would have rated this game as 5 stars.,POSITIVE,0,0.99789232,21-Jul-16
One Clue Crossword : 100s of great free crosswords with picture clues!,This is really a great game. Even though I'm only on the first level I really enjoy this game for every puzzle is different and each puzzle has it's own level of easiness to difficulties. I I've the idea that you play alone with no time standards or order for you pick each puzzle to which one you want to finish first. Can you run out of coins to hep you get a hint to help you solve it  yes  but I fee that they made this game reasonably moderated in the easy to difficulty phase so you can at least play though many levels for you to actually need more coins. Plus this game does have a lot of chances so far in which it gives you bonus coins everyday you play and extra bonus for solving the puzzles. In reality  if you like crossword puzzle and you do them in magazines and in daily papers then you need to download this game. Passes free time with fun  some thought  but no stress or frustration to where you get stuck and can't go on  at least I have not rain into it yet.

Slime Simulator Games,This is a super fun game! I love being able to make the slimes look real! For example  the ice cream slime can be changed so that it looks like vanilla ice cream dripping down a waffle cone! Could the developers of this game make food slime? For example: burger slime  pasta slime  hotdog slime  pizza slime  salad slime  sandwich slime  and steak slime! I would love the  Make Real  feature on those! Also  could you make a popsicle slime? You could also make breakfast themed slime such as bacon  egg  parfait  or granola slime! You could make orange juice slime to go with that! You could make soda slimes  and a lemonade slime with the make real feature! You could make vegetable slimes as well! It sounds like real slime  and my favorite type is the Magic Putty! I would say Poke Me but once you make a dent it doesn't go away until you refresh the shape. Magic Putty removes the dents right after you make them!

Slime Simulator Games,"Bad enough that you must accept a TOS that includes sharing your data (phrased rather vaguely) before getting into the game  but then you find out that while the download is free (download of the TOS and title screen) and you've given permission to access your info  THEN you find out it's a pay to play. There is a DISTINCT difference between  In App Purchasing  and requiring a fee to even get into a game that is advertised as a  Free Download.  I immediately uninstalled this stupid crap before being told that I could not leave a review unless it is installed--never mind that I purchased the game--I reinstalled it just to leave this review and will uninstall it immediately after posting this. Then I will undo the transaction and make sure this stupid BS is not on my account or device in any way.

This is a developer's trick. Minimally  they expect people to give up when they find the unadvertised fee  but be lazy enough to leave it installed (because it is  free  and it's not like you'll need a refund for that) where I'd bet their app will continue to quietly collect and share data. It is underhanded and it is a lie. I will report this app to Amazon and urge anyone else tricked by these developers to do the same.

Dear Developers: I have marked you. I will spread the word about your lies and underhanded dealings and will make sure to never purchase anything else from you  even if it were truly free. You give honest gamers a bad name.",NEGATIVE,1,0.999509573,19-Jan-22

And u can play with it... Only once  though  so make it count! And one time  when it gave me   Putty of the day    It was a REALLY SATISFYING putty  it was like  it had hard black stuff over it  then when u tap on it  under the black stuff is really pretty and cool putty  and its kinda hard to explain  but it was really cool. And I really liked it  and I was probably gonna play with it for as long as possible. But then... Out of nowhere.... IT RANDOMLY STARTED THE GAME OVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LIKE  WHAT???????!??!?!!?!?!? WHAT'S WITH THE GLITCH?????????? I WAS JUST TRYING TO PLAY!!!!!!!!!! Ugh  sry for getting so mad  but I HATE IT when games do that!! Stupid game! And after that  like I said: u can only play with the putty once  so guess what? I COULDN'T PLAY WITH IT ANYMORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ð¡ð¡ð¡ð¡ð¡ð¡ð¡ð¡ð¡!!!! I was so mad!!!!!!!

But yea  there's really not that much. Well  those are the big problems of this game. But I gave it 3 stars cuz its kinda fun... And u can still play it without internet connection. But yea  plz  creators of this game  get rid of those problems. Their really annoying. Well  Bye everyone!!!!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.993811071,26-Apr-24
Slime Simulator Games,This game is really cool. I've seen the adds for this game like crazy but when I fnially downloaded it for free it said that I had to pay 2.99 $ a month. I was disappointed but I thought I Whould go look in the comments to see if it said something about it. And it did someone said that there's a way to not pay. So I tried it and it worked. All I had to do is click our of the payment box and than in the top left corner was an X and I clicked it and it brought me to some slime I was so happy! at first I realized that in the adds It said that I can make spikes but how? But then I saw a arrow in the top left corner and I clicked it. It brought me to a screen with a hole lot of slimes but at the bottom of the screen I saw a bunch or icon but I just had to click the the plus and boom I should create slime. This app is really fun a great but its not perfect. It could be better and not paying makes it so not evary thing Unlocked but most of it is its fun but not perfect but great I'm addicted to this game. ðð,POSITIVE,0,0.963763058,30-Jun-22
Slime Simulator Games,How could any one say this is trash ? I don't understand that they mist have very big fingers or something. I love art and pictures and so I loved this so so much !! I really don't get how you could even delete this one it is unique  and realistic  and smart. You can even put a picture from your files onto some of them.  At first I wasn't sure how to make gold on it but I figured it out that you just collect it after playing with each slime starting at the top first.  Do download.,POSITIVE,0,0.994711161,12-Feb-23
Slime Simulator Games,Bro you have to pay for it and also it should just be paid for when you get the game its so confusing 4.99 a month. I'm wouldn't waste a dime on this crap if I could I'd give it 0 stars terrible game and terrible deal,NEGATIVE,1,0.998536587,27-Apr-24

Slime Simulator Games,This app's a blast  no doubt  but those ads? Ugh  major buzzkill. My advice? Flip on airplane mode for a nearly ad-free experience. Anyway  you start with basic textures  then hustle slime orders to score coins for cooler stuff. Plus  you can  record  videos to get more  followers   which is hilarious. And playing with your slime? Total riot! Out of the other slime games I tried  this one's tops. Five stars  especially without the ads.,POSITIVE,0,0.930604041,28-Apr-24
Slime Simulator Games,The game is overall a great game in my opinion but there's this glitch when I go to the customisation or custom slime tab the  screen  goes behind the slimes and I can't customize or make any smiles if u fix this glitch it would be highly appreciated,NEGATIVE,1,0.985798061,29-Dec-23

WorldCraft: 3D Build & Craft with Skins Export to Minecraft,This game just doesn't cut it as a replacement for anything. The controls are kinda sloppy and not very responsive  especially when you're flying around. Plus  not being able to make your own skins and the lack of variety in creative mode are big letdowns. I wouldn't really suggest bothering with it. But hey  it does get a little props for having some real people skins and worlds.

Guess Their Answer,This game is really fun  but it would be ALOT  better if their were less ads. Every time you collect money you get an ad. Every three minutes basically. I would normally turn off my wifi  which I tried  but you have to have WiFi to play this game. It looked fun on another ad I saw  I was so excited!

And sometimes it glitches out the game  making me redo the round  which drives me nuts. The game itself is a blast  but holy smokes  it's like ad overload.

Guess Their Answer,"When I played the game for the first time it was overall a pretty good game but after every round there was an ad that probably caused me to lag out of the game and I had to do the round again which gets pretty annoying for me and yes  I do know that there's VIP which gives you no ads and some skins which sounds pretty cool to me and I understand you are trying to make money and who I mean by  you  are the creator(s) of this game also me and multiple people just want there to be less ads in the game since the ads just ruin the gameplay so 3 stars because the game is overall pretty good

Would You Rather?,This is one of the few games that I actually give give stars to. This game is truly one of a kind and it keeps me occupied for hours. This game gives you two options. You choose which one you would have to go through and it shows you the percentages of people who picked each option. What I'm saying kinda doesn't make sense  does it? Well... Here. Example:  Would You Rather? Lick a strangers shoe  or  lick your realitive's shoe?  You pick... Then it says...  27 percent of people chose option one. 73 percent of people chose option two.  So it's cool how you can see how many people think alike. And the options are always one of a kind and original. And if you take this game seriously  and look at each question carefully and don't just zoom through it... It actually takes a while to figure it out  some you REALLY have to think about... That's really all that needs to be said  other than its an all around wonderful game. I enjoyed it... Will you? (Guys please tell me if you think I should keep doing game reviews and if I should keep doing that at the end. You know...  Will you?  Thing... Make sure to give this review a  helpful.

Would You Rather?,"For some reason  I get addicted on making my own  Would you rather?  questions. I don't like that the ad always pop up after submitting each question. More unfair than just answering a couple of questions before advertisement. The questions that the people made are just meh. Some questions are very basic and some are weird.

I have been thinking that it would be better if we submit our own questions  it gets reviewed by admin(s) in 24 hours or more. If it is not a duplicate  inappropriate  or a troll question  it gets accepted and added in the game. That is much faster than waiting the next update for more questions. More questions = less boredom and less chances of finding the same questions that we already answered.

Maybe we can have an option of making our own account and have like a leaderboard of who submitted the most questions that got added into the game (encourages creativity). The reason why I didn't put  who submitted the most questions  is because of spammers and trash submitting.

Maybe for account options  we can hide the percentages  hide ads (have to pay money first because I know that the creator needs money from ads)  hide questions that you already answered before  personalize the colors (red and blue answer options can be other basic colors). More complex color textures like galaxy  lava  flowers  water  space stars  frosting sprinkles  rainbow  gold  flames  etc. can be bought with real money or be top 10% in the leaderboard to unlock those textures. Then we have background colors (white  grey  and default). For more complex textures and more colors for background  buy with real money or be in top 10% in leaderboard.

Thanks to whoever read my entire review and I hope the creator sees my suggestions.",NEGATIVE,1,0.998899698,30-Jun-20

Minecraft,I love the game  but recent updates have caused issues. First of all  the sensitivity of the item must of been lowered or something. It takes like three taps to change the item in my hand. It makes me place items everywhere or have to look at the sky when changing items. I've adjusted well enough to the controls  but still want the old ones back. My biggest issue is a recent bug that will not give me the option to sleep. I've updated the app and the issue still continues.,NEGATIVE,1,0.944078982,28-Apr-24
Minecraft,I love the game but It change a lot over the past few years  and some features that we usually become used to  suddenly disappear... About the new minecraft bedrock control modes  one of them is the classic controls but it didn't inherit all of the old controller's traits. Especially the middle button in the fly control. Now it's more confusing because they completely erase it from existence. Bring back the old one.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999325991,28-Apr-24
Minecraft,The changes on the controls are so dissapointing. Mojang really is best when it comes to changing something that doesn't need it. The jump-forward action is much harder now  and the controls are objectively awful to look at. Not to mention that it's forced on everybody  no settings to revert into the old one. This company needs to seriously rethink their update priorities.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99568826,27-Apr-24
Minecraft,I can tell that the Mobile Size Controls are new and i figured about it's size limits. If you put it up to 100  the controls are smaller than usual that suppose to be the biggest. When i check it on my phone  it usually goes smaller. But putting it to 70 or 80  its bigger than any size selections. It relies on how big the device you use. I imagine if it puts to 100  the controls are GIANT like the Giant scale option. I'll put it 4 because i love the variants they have now in newest versions!,NEGATIVE,1,0.786474824,24-Apr-24
Minecraft,I love the game especially because it's the only game me and my fiance can play together but the new controls are almost impossible to use. I keep thinking I'll get used to them but I can't. They're too far towards the center and it's making it difficult to run or even just move and on top of that I can't just hold the swim button and stay afloat anymore bc the second I pop above the surface it switches back to the jump button so I sink back down  making it impossible to swim places quickly.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99356693,5-Apr-24
Minecraft,Perfect. 5 Stars. edit: the new controls are really messing with my game-play. i understand you can go back and change it to the old controls on mobile  however  they're still slightly different  and it makes moving around and completing certain tasks difficult to accomplish. please give us back the original controls with no tweaks.,NEGATIVE,1,0.967998028,24-Apr-24
Minecraft,So it's awesome  but I am having problems when my friend tried to join but it says outdated client I think it's a bug I don't know but it was annoying and it keep freezing up in a game so it was being a nuisance.

Minecraft,Been a Minecraft fan since released in 2009. There used to be tons of bugs involving multiplayer  but they've mostly been fixed. I don't play Minecraft PE anymore because I have an Xbox and a Pc  but Mojang has really been locked in on bug fixes lately. The lack of accessible content can be a kill joy sometimes  but the addons are a great concept that has been implemented because of the endless possibilities.

Minecraft,This is the best game i have played in years! It is creative  it has no boundaries  and the game is just pure and simple fun  and you can also play with freinds anywhere in the world.

Apart from thise things the game is beutiful.,POSITIVE,0,0.991682649,2-Apr-24
Minecraft,This game is very fun. I still kinda wish there were more PC features in mobile  but I enjoy playing mobile anyway. Now  the issue I really am concerned with is the controls. The old version before the most recent update are my favorite controls  and my muscle memory is so used to it. The new update took those controls away  and it makes the game less fun if I'm an infant just learning to crawl in the middle of a build...

Minecraft,Minecraft is technically my favorite game. However  before Mojang adds something new  they often make changes that are very annoying. One example  before the update  they made touch controls unplayable for me  and crafting stacks of recipes took a long time. Additionally  some machines work in a flat world but not in my survival world. I deleted it because of cycles like that. in short  they were not trying to fix common issues  by overlooking its heavy  i give it 3 stars.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998739302,14-Apr-24
Minecraft,It is a good nice sandbox game where you can explore build and play with your friends. Most of the bugs in Bedrock have been fixed but when i sleep at night when its raining i wake up i still see the rain. Its annoying since I can't even see anything when it happens. It would be much better with the rain glitch patched. Another thing I don't like is the fact that sometimes when exit and come back   time has passed in my mc world. I would still say BE is a good game I enjoyed it a lot.,POSITIVE,0,0.993127465,10-Apr-24
Minecraft,Legendary game that I've been playing for years on PC at this point  and recently started playing on mobile for an on the go experience.

Minecraft,The old TouchPad worked just fine if not the best  the newer one is unusable  it doesn't read the touch control well  making it place blocks or makes the character stop completely if the finger is not on the useless small arrow keys  give us the old TouchPad please  don't use useless style changes to the game when you can be added a unique mob or making a biom better but please stop messing with game mechanics,NEGATIVE,1,0.996849835,28-Apr-24
Minecraft,I have played Minecraft on Mobile for a really long time and recently they changed the controls on mobile making it harder to play  the gaps between them and the size (which even though I set the same as the old controls) just isn't the same anymore.

Minecraft,I love this game and the experience. However  theres a bug where its not saving any skins. Also when I upload a custom skin  I am told  thats not a minecraft skin  silly!  No matter what I do. Another thing is the controls- please give the option for old controls back. It messes with muscel memory and no amount of  adjustment  will fix that.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999172986,7-Apr-24
Minecraft,Great game. I like the features and the mini games added aswell. But as a PE player for more than one year now  I have spotted some issues. Let's start from the first one: the game gets a bit repetitive after a while. Building in a world for a while gets a bit boring. As an offline game  though it's great to play if you are only doing it for 5-10 mins! But the recent issue I have has occured since the recent update. The mojang screen just loads for 30 mins and I have to wait until it loads. Help,NEGATIVE,1,0.997806132,14-Feb-24
Minecraft,My review used to be 5 stars  but now I am changing it. So  minecraft on the mobile isn't good. It crashes all the time  and I know it isn't my side that's the problem since it happens to my friend who also plays it. It kicks you out of the game for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Please fix this issue. I will say I think the controls are fun  but they need more customization options  and please add a button to change your perspective and to swap between items in the hotbar.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998916626,20-Mar-24
Minecraft,Minecraft mobile has completely revolutionized my gaming experience. As a long-time fan of the franchise  I was initially skeptical about how well the game would translate to mobile platforms  but I was pleasantly surprised.

Minecraft,It was an amazing game with a lot to do and explore but with recent updates the game keeps crashing when I open the setting menu or even while in a world.

Minecraft,Don't get me wrong  I love this game and have played it for over 12 years across platforms. But lately the game's performance has been getting worse and worse on mobile devices. I have a fairly powerful phone  and yet I'm finding myself playing with the lowest graphic/rendering settings  and still experiencing stuttering. Some optimization and performance work are desperately needed. Also cannot emphasize how frustrating it is to pay for Realms and not be able to access it due to server issues..,NEGATIVE,1,0.996774971,2-Mar-24
Minecraft,really love the game & all; been playing console for like 10 years & mobile for the last year. downside recently though would have to be the recent update 1.20.71 with the controls on mobile. used to be the choice to use arrows to move forward/backwards side to side  which was my first choice  but that was removed. bow it's just the analog  which is stupid imo. please bring that back.,NEGATIVE,1,0.992038846,14-Mar-24
Minecraft,I absolutely despise the new controls. I was so used to the old d-pad and now i have to completely change my playstyle. The way to fly down should not be the same button you use to stop flying  and what happened to the steak middle button? If you're gonna change that  at least have a  Classic  option with the old d-pad.

Minecraft,I have been a Minecraft fan for more then a decade and i truly enjoy every aspect of it. I'm just grately disappointed at the multiplier trouble shooting error that constantly appears every other update . The tips are of no help for me nor my friends and it degrades the quality of the game when such an important feature is not able to do what needs to be done .

Minecraft,I've been playing Minecraft for a long time on mobile. I always loved their simplicity on buttons and textures. But recently they changed the old D Pad control with the new one. At first I thought they only updated the texture for d pad. But they really changed it with much more horrible control. The now D Pad has gaps between them.

Minecraft,Minecraft is a fun creative game that brings together people. Minecraft has a multiplayer gamemode that allows you to play with your friends even if you are living in different countries.

Minecraft,The new controls are fine. You can still change it to be like before  but it's a little different. However  the slight movement of some parts of the control is really bugging me  and I can't figure out how to make the position how it used to be.

Minecraft,Mojang lost my account. I've since created an Xbox Microsoft account and bought it for java  bedrock  oculus rift (no longer developed) and android. It would've been great to buy once for multiple platforms  and make versions play well together  but they don't. I used to play this often but now you can't export phone worlds without realms  since by default it saves them in a weird place. That's a deal breaker for me  so won't be playing anymore.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994731665,18-Mar-24
Minecraft,Why do you periodically change the controller interface? It's not a bug that needs to be fixed...some of us liked it fine the way it's been for years. Last time we had the option to restore the original one  the latest update doesn't seem to  and your new controller is AWFUL! Its position and size take up more of the playing surface...why? It may seem like a marginal change  but when playing on a mobile phone  not a tablet  it's a bigger deal/a larger proportion of the play area.,POSITIVE,0,0.818613052,16-Mar-24
Minecraft,I really enjoy the game's endless creativity and variety of servers to choose from. However  the D-pad controls are a bit frustrating for me. I'd love the option to revert to the old controls. Additionally  the experimental size control is limited to 70 when it should go up to 100. It's so small that it's comparable to an ant in size. Please fix this issue!,NEGATIVE,1,0.994845867,24-Mar-24
Minecraft,I've been playing this game on and off for ~10 years and quite frankly new new controls suck. Please give us an option for the old D pad controls. The new ones are janky when changing directs  and if playing with jump and sneak swapped don't work properly at all. This has made the game incredibly difficult to play for me. The new update has also made the game so laggy.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999792755,26-Apr-24
Minecraft,Please please please!! I am having issues with connecting to the realms through mobile data. I am using reliance jio sim card.

Minecraft,I often like to revisit this game to reminisce on the good old days. I still remember pocket edition back when infinite worlds weren't a thing and the nether reactor core was a thing. Oh and don't get me started with seeing GRASS on multiplayer lifeboat server in it's prime for the first time. This game really shines when you play with friends on a LAN single player world oh the memories forged from it! and do be warned it's a complex game that can technically be played forever.,POSITIVE,0,0.999593794,10-Apr-24
Minecraft,Ever since I updated my game to 1.20 the game freezes repeatedly every few seconds. There are constant lag spikes which are really annoying. I thought the developers would definitely fix it in an upcoming update but it's been 6-7 months and still this issue hasn't been fixed. This is really very disappointing. (Note: I have good device  I reinstall the game and also reset my device too.),NEGATIVE,1,0.999482512,25-Mar-24
Minecraft,I do really really love this game and have been playing it for ages. I've relatively recently got it on my phone and have found it works really well except for the fact that a lot of the times I will join my world  walk around and then the whole game lags out and the game crashes. I've tried shutting down and restarting my phone etc etc but wondered if there was any way I could fix this. Other than that the game is incredible.,NEGATIVE,1,0.590729058,15-Apr-24
Minecraft,Stuttering is so bad that I'm about to switch to peaceful because any combat with that and those on screen controls sounds dreadful. S23 Ultra by the way. No graphics settings seem to affect it. I would blame my phone  as I don't know how the previous versions performed  but I'm reading a lot of similar complaints from people with different phones too.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99976474,27-Feb-24
Minecraft,In order to play this on my phone I had remove all the fancy settings/textures like pretty skies  leaf's  clouds  etc. I still lag and crash but it doesn't happen too often. I can tell if I'm about to crash because I get a lag spike  all I have to do is stop moving for about 10 to 20 seconds and I can continue playing without crashing. Sucks I can't have those nice settings to make my gameplay a lot prettier.,NEGATIVE,1,0.98968327,4-Mar-24
Minecraft,I enjoy playing the game and the updates are usually pretty good  but recently the controls for pocket edition were changed. It wasn't a huge change but it's definitely frustrating. There's a glitch with the button that allows you to bob up and down in water and in general the controls are hard to use. I prefer the old ones to the new ones  and even though I could learn to use the new ones  not being able to play as I used to is driving me away from playing all together so I may not learn.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995009065,17-Mar-24
Minecraft,it feels like with every new update the mobile version of the game becomes more and more unplayable. The frame issues (random lag spikes for no reason often freezing for a whole minute) make the game honestly an overall bad experience. (Not to mention the actual lack of substance that came within the past few updates). I have big expectations for 1.21,NEGATIVE,1,0.999656916,21-Mar-24
Minecraft,I really love this game  but the update to the D-pad controls are horrible.. literally made the game 5x harder to play in mobile. Hopefully you can add an option to revert back to the old controls or at least make the current one function the same as the old one instead of it breaking my movement whenever my finger moves to a different arrow/direction and moves my camera instead.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999376833,27-Mar-24
Minecraft,Even 13 years later  still a fine classic. Infinite creative potential. No two worlds are the same  so there's a lot of exploration  which is fun. Lots of replayability. So many diverse biomes and blocks. One thing I'd love to see is an End or Desert revamp. Soundtrack's beautiful (R.I.P. C418)  and makes the experience a lot more charming and unique (Pigstep go brr). The touch controls are good  there's controller+keyboard compatibility  and world customization features/settings. 100% worth it.,POSITIVE,0,0.999815166,7-Feb-24
Minecraft,The new d-pad is the worst. Creative fly mode ruined how players used to control while flying. The flying up and down button can't press simultaneously stroke. Have to press it in order or one time per button. Missing the middle button(jump) in creative fly mode. This is important because players offten fly up and down a lot  and I offten disable fly mode by flying down multiple times. Please add the jump button back in creative fly mode to prevent this. Thank you for listening to players.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999721825,10-Apr-24
Minecraft,I would give it a 5 star review! But as for now  it is a 3 star as a mobile player. I was trying to play the game as normal  and then the screen turned black and kicked me out of the game  and when I joined back what I was doing before some of my progress was deleted and also it's not just 1 time it's like all the time your trying to play the game! It just brings you to a black screen and removes some of your stuff you were working on. After all the game is good. Mincraft Pls Fix This Issue.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99748069,17-Apr-24
Minecraft,It's a nice game i am playing it from around 6 years now but now it's too laggy and buggy the customisable comtrols are good but there are some bugs in it like the controls get reset every time even when i don't touch any button on the red line and its so bug full that my mobile phone gets freezed many times due to i have low end device and its started from the customisable controls ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.998280644,30-Apr-24
Minecraft,The new touch controls are terrible  they aren't just awkward  at best they're physically uncomfortable and sometimes outright painful to use now  I can't play the game right now or I'm going to sprain my wrists trying. Even ignoring the changes to the UI  breaking blocks and flying in creative is weird now too  on top of not swimming up with autojump on anymore  and you can't start flying if you're underwater. Mining is laggy  it takes a second to break stuff and then you'll break EVERYTHING!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999143243,29-Mar-24
Minecraft,Just updated the app today  and the new D-pad controller is weird. The visual itself needs some time getting used to  but also now the odd gaps between the pads make me stop running and jumping at the same time. I'll be sprinting for a bit and then start walking  which is going to be INSANE to do in pvp or just normal survival. Pls bring back the old D-pad controls.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998352528,13-Mar-24
Minecraft,I love minecraft  I've been playing since the bee update. But lately  I've been very discouraged from playing it. The reason being are the touch controls. It's literally unplayable and makes it very hard for newcomers and regular players. The design and style of the new ones don't match the games vibe and there are several bugs/ problems with the new ones. Make it a choice to use the old settings/dpad and touch controls usable again! Listen to your community!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999248087,23-Mar-24
Minecraft,been kicking me out and I don't even get to play for 10 minutes. I've restarted my phone many times and deleted and reinstalled (it deleted everything) And if I'm holding something while it kicks me out  when I rejoin the world that item will be gone and it resets some progress. please fix this I love this game. It changed my game controls and won't let me change it back Update: I've deleted it  Won't even run. Makes my whole phone act up.,POSITIVE,0,0.708722174,26-Mar-24
Minecraft,Have been playing since the nether reactor was still a thing lol  I was 8 and this was a great outlet for my creativity. It just sucks that now that I want to buy a realm it's not letting me. Tried removing and adding my payment method  triple checking my information and it still won't let me. I just hope that if it finally goes through it won't charge me for each time it failed.,POSITIVE,0,0.983773232,7-Mar-24
Minecraft,The new control scheme is awful. The controls are too far in from the sides and there is no longer an option for lefties. The experimental customizable controls switch sides when you try to fly in creative. When taking off or landing in creative the game also registers an extra screen clink  which causes a bunch of extra blocks to be placed. Hopefully this will be fixed soon  as there was no need to change the controls in the first place.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998891056,17-Mar-24
Minecraft,I have been playing Minecraft for really long time and suddenly I stopped playing it because it keeps crashing just when I opened the app.My device storage still alot and my phone should able to run Minecraft smoothly  Iam sure other user familiar with this problem.

Minecraft,I have been playing since the pretty early stages  (can't remember the exact year  but it's been a good 10 years.) I recently joined the beta program (because yay  early updates) and instantly regretted it. I couldn't join friends  and when I left the program  deleted the app  and reinstalled  I was still in the beta program. This game is great and I recommend everyone should play it  but whatever you do  just wait until the release comes out.,NEGATIVE,1,0.990977883,9-Feb-24
Minecraft,This game is really fun  I prefer casual building or making a map for my friends to play. There's so much stuff you can do in this game. Build  fight  mod the game and get stuff from the marketplace. It's a multiplayer game too! And some people have servers where you can play with many different players. But I think that mobile  Xbox  ect should have the same stuff as PCs (like being able to be on a server when the original host isn't on) because I think it would make it a lot more fun,POSITIVE,0,0.894202173,18-Feb-24
Minecraft,This is a review for the phone. I advise being careful when you purchase this game  as I had played it before and pretty much impulse bought it. It takes up A LOT of space (necessary for all the simulation) and I find I don't play it much because you need to set aside quite a bit of time  so I'm not sure if it was worth the purchase. Of course  the graphics and everything else is amazing as this is a highly developed game  so I would recommend  just make sure you will actually use it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.876692533,4-Apr-24
Minecraft,I love this game  but I have an issue with the updated controls on the pocket edition. They're a different size  which makes them difficult to use due to muscle memory. More importantly  it is almost impossible to travel diagonally now  and the flight controls are very unintuitive. I had to call my brother to figure out how to get down from flying.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997591257,14-Mar-24
Minecraft,I don't like the newer approach on this game. The recent updates have been too random and I miss the old world generation. Instead of expanding the already existing features (potions  weapons  etc.) They decided to update stuff that was fine like world generation. Now my builds look weird with the over detailed world generation. If you want the better minecraft experience then just get it on an xbox 360. (The marketplace also sucks.),NEGATIVE,1,0.998669267,27-Apr-24
Minecraft,I've loved playing this game but with the recent change of the d-pad controls I have not been playing at all. I was so used to the old controls that I can't even play now. Theres a feature in the d-pad that lets you move foward and to the side at the same time but now the space between the buttons cause you to just stop moving entirely.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994284809,5-Apr-24
Minecraft,New mobile controls have made it horrible to play   I've quit completely because of them . Absolutely infuriating. Just make them optional... why would you ruin player experience forcefully instead of giving a choice. Just make an option to go back to regular controls  then people can pick and choose what they prefer. Instead you are making people that love this game unable to play.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999569595,9-Apr-24
Minecraft,It's a wonderful game  but I have a terrible issue playing with my dual shock 4 controller. For some reason when using my triggers it interprets 2 clicks instead of one and places 2 blocks for example.

Minecraft,They basically broke the game  for Mobile players. As it refuses to open  or even load some smps / servers. It constantly lags  and crashes the game. It's been a problem for months.  Bug Fixes   that they do  basically just break the game worse and makes it unplayable for others. The game itself  is good - do not get me wrong. It's the lack of care  for the development of Bedrock / PE Minecraft. Others have complained about this for months  yet nothing has been fixed. It's truly depressing.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999246359,15-Mar-24
Minecraft,Please Please PLEASE bring back the dpad control. Almost all the reviews are asking for it back. The new controls are very bad and extremely hard to use and doesn't fit the game very well at all. And the game crashes way to much it crashes after playing for like 1-5 mins.

Minecraft,I love everything on this game  but the new  d-pad and tap to interact  thing gives me a bit of the ick.

Minecraft,Crashes after you die  so you lose everything. Also  combat is inconsistent because when you hold to attack  you randomly just stop swinging your sword after like 2 seconds. Unless you're looking directly at an enemy while you swing  then he won't attack AT ALL! You literally have to look where to want to fight then press attack. Okay and with only 1 finger  while they constantly use pixel skipping dodge maneuvers left and right  and there's 3 of them. Seriously combat is ATROCIOUS.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995753407,21-Feb-24

Minecraft,I love playing Minecraft and everything is normal as always! But there's one problem. I play on phone and I'm not sure this is temporary or not.

I kinda figured a big like that would've already been ironed out  especially on an update they've been working on for a bit now before releasing it.

Minecraft,It a really good game but u play bedrock (mobile) and it been lagging a lot. I know it's not my Internet because I've never had a problem til the recent update where you can now crouch under 1.5 blocks and craft boats with needing a shovel I can't play even 5 mins without crashing and the game kicking me out. I have also noticed that a lot of other people are having this problem.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995037496,13-Feb-24
Minecraft,Used to be great  but not so much nowadays. Navigating the overall UI felt buggy and sluggish  especially the setting. Setting options are lazily implemented and not much options. Control is weirdly worse than it used to feel. Still no ray tracing on capable hardware. And worst of all  STOP SHOVING MICRO TRANSACTIONS AT EVERY CORNER OF THE GAME MENU. Would understand if this is a f2p game but this game is priced  and still got more pesky  new paid contents  inside.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999645352,29-Mar-24
Minecraft,please give us the option of using the old touch controls  the new ones are ugly :( edit. brining this down to a one star review after playing around with it for a bit  the difference between the new and old D pad is horrible  whoever decided this was a good idea should be fired. you cannot just change the controls of a game randomly like that and putting things in new places. put the d pad back or at least give us the option to chose which version we want. it's also still ugly,NEGATIVE,1,0.999814332,14-Mar-24
Minecraft,I've played minecraft for as long as I can remember. Unfortunately my friends and family across the sea can only play on there xbox series x. And I play mobile. Everything works there's no problem with the multi-player. The only problem is that if I make a character using the in game character creator with cosmetics etc. [Spend to much money on cosmetics tbh]. I can see there's. But they can't see mine. This is really frustrating. The only thing they see is the regular Steve or Alex. Pls fix,NEGATIVE,1,0.998833954,24-Feb-24
Minecraft,The game was good  but the updates slowly made it worse each time. First the create world screen was changed  then the controls were changed to joystick  and I spent half an hour trying to switch to the old ones. And now you changed the d-pad  I cannot control myself anymore and i cant play anymore. Its very trashy and it ruins the game.STOP TRYING TO MODERNIZE,NEGATIVE,1,0.999769151,15-Mar-24
Minecraft,I dislike the overall direction Microsoft has taken this game in. If you like it then that's perfectly fine  but I just don't like it anymore. In my experience it's often buggy and unstable  which can make it sometimes just borderline unplayable. In my opinion  it's a disappointing version of Minecraft and it's very saddening and disappointing to know that they discontinued the legacy console versions to port this inferior and lackluster version to them.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999702871,23-Feb-24
Minecraft,This game is seriously fun! I've been playing this game since 2014  and it's always been wonderful. I've noticed a lot of other people talking about missing the old d-pad controls  but you can get those back in settings. There are two separate settings for the control type and the size thereof  but they aren't that difficult to find!,POSITIVE,0,0.999696732,14-Apr-24
Minecraft,Now it's getting worst. First  I couldn't enjoy the things I bought on market place everytime I turn off the mobile data/wifi  also the skin and custom characters. Second  We can't play on LAN anymore which is very annoying  you now need to have an internet connection to do so (what's to point of playing on Lan then?) This will be the start of the downfall as it takes away its playability on LAN(without data/internet connection) fix this Mojang/Microsoft ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.999727309,2-Apr-24
Minecraft,what's up with the new buttons? literal eyesore I don't know why they got changed? nobody had an issue with the other ones and you can't turn it off in the touch control settings. this might be a me issue but I also can't change the size of the buttons. they look huge right now and I can't make them smaller. idk I hate the new buttons please at least make it an option to change them back :/,NEGATIVE,1,0.995397747,16-Mar-24
Minecraft,I love the game. But with whatever update the new control types came in  it made it impossible for me to make a world. It automaticly pulls up the select control type screen. I am unable to navigate this screen because I assume the required buttons are stuck offscreen. The only button I can see is the one that sends me back.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998152435,4-Apr-24
Minecraft,The game is great and fun and all that I have been playing it ever since it came out back when I was in elementary school and all the updates were amazing til now but recently minecraft is just unplayable every time I play the game freezes or like gives me a lag spike. Which is annoying I lost a lot of my stuff due to this freezing or lag that happens while playing specially when I was fighting ender dragon I lost. Because the game freezes a lot. Please fix this,NEGATIVE,1,0.998105049,11-Apr-24
Minecraft,Gameplay is good except it freezes for a second and a half every few seconds of gameplay. When that happens my phone keeps telling me to close it and won't stop till I do. Don't even bother playing online because everyone will basically speed bridge to you and knock you off before you even get to play.,POSITIVE,0,0.847048283,13-Apr-24
Minecraft,I've always loved this game. It's nostalgic  open  and simple  and never fails to entertain me. There are always new surprises and not many bugs or glitches. It's kept its prestige for years and years  but I wish all the mobs in mob votes could be added instead of canceling the ones that didn't qualify.,POSITIVE,0,0.998871624,18-Feb-24
Minecraft,Alright  just scratch the whole new control design update. Even the classic D-Pad with Tap Control has changed so much that it's unplayable now. There is so much space between every movement button that it constantly rotates my screen whenever I move my thumb between those buttons (which means that the space in between the buttons is part of the interactive screen instead of it being part of the movement area  like earlier  before they changed the design of the D-Pad horribly).,NEGATIVE,1,0.993316889,13-Mar-24
Minecraft,I have been playing Minecraft since 2012  It looks like I won't be able to play it ever ð. All the updates have taken the game to UNPLAYABLE state. The old style control mechanism does not work as good as before. Also  there are updates that has ruined the originality of the game. On top it looks like to me that the game is having optimisation issues  and this is attempted to be solved by hardware  which I can see from CPU consumption. *Amature SW engineer solution*. Goodbye  my old friend ð­,NEGATIVE,1,0.999802411,21-Apr-24
Minecraft,1.20.30 update has made the Android app unplayable. Placing blocks or activating doors etc registers multiple times while using Razor Kishi  doing anything is vitually impossible alongside consistent stuttering every 30 seconds it's a mess. 1.20.62! has still not fixed the gamepad issue. Going to open a bug tracker report. How a game killing bug like this went past QA  was implemented into a full update and then wasn't fixed in a hot fix is actually baffling like how did nobody notice this......,NEGATIVE,1,0.999733627,15-Feb-24
Minecraft,I love this gane ever since i got it i played with friends build cool structures but i always lag in other servers then i get disconnected the only thing i can do now is play solo with no friends and playing solo is boring i was hoping that it was something that will go away after a day but it still remains now i cannot do anything fun and now im bored every time i cannt play multiplayer. I hope this can get fixed soon,NEGATIVE,1,0.999370992,27-Apr-24
Minecraft,Use to be more fun. I bought this game years ago and transferred it each time I got a new phone. This time  I had to buy it all over again. I lost all the worlds I created. Now  on an S24 Ultra  it stutters when it's the only app running. The fill command is always claiming I  can't place blocks outside the world  so I have to place them one at a time. Had it been like this when I first started playing  I wouldn't be playing it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999675512,11-Apr-24
Minecraft,It's been a month now and the controls are still broken. It's honestly if the new controls weren't even play tested at mojang because they feel very unintuitive. I've played consistently on mobile since 2016 and this is bad enough that I've stopped playing. Games largely unplayable now  hence the 1 star review. It's a lovely game but if I can't play it due to poor controls  then that's an easy 1 star review.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998757601,13-Apr-24
Minecraft,Cool game. But good luck playing with someone. This game is absolutely terrible when trying to play with someone. My kid is on my old 13 pro max. I'm on PC. Been trying for hours to connect and play with him. He's in tears and I'm super frustrated. Tried 500 times. Emailed tech support. Like it's beyond dumb. They need to make the connects better instead of adding all these other modes,NEGATIVE,1,0.998750687,4-Mar-24
Minecraft,Uhm  hello Mojang  the game has bin really buggy everytime I try to play it  I only play for two minutes and then I lag too much that I have to restart my phone. I do hope this problem can be fixed because I love playing minecraft on my phone when travelling but I can't if its just gonna bug too much after two minutes of game play  in hopes of this. I really hope you fix it because I don't want it to leave my phone. Thank you Mojang.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998282075,29-Feb-24
Minecraft,The game is fun but it lacks in some departments. The combat is boring because there is nothing for you to fight. You work hard and get the best loot and gear just to find out there is nothing to fight. The ender dragon is a stupid boss  it is really annoying to get to and isn't worth it. The boss just flies around and rarely lands in the middle. Then you can go in and hit 30 times and it dies. The combat isn't the only problem though  because mining is really repetitive. Not the best game here.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999389648,29-Mar-24
Minecraft,Sometimes the screen view lags back and forth and the settings are a bit finicky. The graphics on the other hand are phenominal and I love how easy to mod and customize the game is!

Minecraft,This game is a blast! I had a great time with my friends  exploring different worlds and activities. When survival mode gets old  we can switch to other servers and have more fun. This game is a must-play for anyone who loves adventure and creativity. The only downside is the occasional bug that makes logging in a hassle. But thatâs a minor issue compared to the awesome gameplay.,POSITIVE,0,0.996635616,19-Apr-24
Minecraft,Best game I've ever played hands down. There are a few bugs with mobile  as to be expected. The controls are kind of buggy and need more variety  me personally really want to be able to use split controls on the joystick without those buggy buttons and split the sensitivity to x sensitivity and y sensitivity. Great game  though.,POSITIVE,0,0.934989929,17-Feb-24
Minecraft,Look I love the game  it works well  I luckily haven't been getting any lag but the thing that angers me is when you get mods  I try to get the most simple shaders and because of how this version of Minecraft is all it does is change the sky and makes the render very foggy but yet I could use this on PC and it works perfectly bedrock and Java  if we could find a way to fix this then it would be great  another reason are the controls  they are great but all things considerate they are janky,NEGATIVE,1,0.977507412,18-Apr-24
Minecraft,I love every update. But aside from upgrading each existing biome  I do wish for something completely different. Like a new biome or dimension. A unique naturally generated build in the overworld or another portal that leads somewhere else. Aside from those  we all wanted a new major boss  specifically those whose healthbar are shown at the top of your screen. But I'm still looking forward to whatever will be added in this game. And maybe a second upgrade for all the previous upgrades.,POSITIVE,0,0.997649848,7-Feb-24
Minecraft,Minecraft is really good  but can you guys fix how the armor looks when it is enchanted because it looks like a solid block of material on my phone (new update) can yall please add back the original jump button and arrows keys because the new ones are a little further from the screen so when I want to go jump I clicked beside of it.,POSITIVE,0,0.669912934,12-Apr-24

Minecraft,Amazing but I'm giving it a 4 star bc When I try to move the camera the screen shakes   Although overall  it's a great game. You can add friends if you're signed and obviously   really good game. Although one thing I am kind of creeped out about in the game is that there's a bunch of videos on YouTube that's like There's a bunch of like crosses âï¸ or entities that are in our worlds and I've tried out all of the myths and I have Discovered that turned most of them are real .(very scary).,POSITIVE,0,0.985533834,17-Mar-24
Minecraft,From 5* to 1*. I love the game but it crashes so much the last week. The new add-ons I just bought all seem to either cause lag or full-on crashes.

Minecraft,I really enjoy playing this game with the Kishi remote on my mobile. I wish they had dual weapons in Bedrock  like Java. The updates have been pretty good so far  but there's a lot of lag in Bedrock that is really annoying. I'm hoping they can fix it as soon as possible.

Minecraft,I love Minecraft and always have  it's a perfect game for everyone. But I've been having some problems. My Minecraft is slow and when I'm on a world my screen will randomly turn black and exit the app  and it's been happening for a while.

Minecraft,I have played Minecraft for around 5 years now and I have not had a bad experience however this version does not seem to be playing like the version on my windows laptop. Whenever you try to move it lags  if you open your inventory or any chests then the game will lag and eventually crash  and it causes my phone shut down all together. Just a general dissapointment as you can't even join servers as it will cause it to throw you off  a waste of Â£7. I love Minecraft all together but this sucks.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999271452,12-Apr-24
Minecraft,The new D-pad is the worst addition yet. I always knew where I was touching without looking at the screen. Now  I don't even know what I'm doing. Please revert to the old design and its original placement. Customizing isn't helpful if I don't know where to place things. It's frustrating as a parkour creator that I can't even play properly.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999793708,24-Mar-24
Minecraft,I used to enjoy playing minecraft on my phone from time to time but I got on it again recently and I noticed the new ui. I got to say I really don't like it.

Minecraft,Great game I play it at least 3 times a week with my kid. unfortunately it kicks me out every few minutes  so if we're on an adventure or fighting the ender dragon we will lose because I can't help. totally ruins our game play and I'm getting to the point I'm going to delete and find something else for us to play. my son has autism so these frequent stops and glitching can cause meltdowns. thanks minecraft for creating such a great game but making it so poopy to even use it!!! update. still :'(,NEGATIVE,1,0.999126017,27-Feb-24
Minecraft,The game is fun but the controls are awful  all the three control options are hard to use and the button placement customisation is very rigid and doesn't let you move the on screen info like coordinates  player doll etc on wherever you wish to. If mojang work on this issue then pocket edition will be much better.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998513281,18-Feb-24
Minecraft,The new control layout is horrible. What were you thinking? Buttons have been repositioned and are now harder to even hit. Also  the fly and fall buttons in creative mode not being in the same spot anymore is the worst decision you've ever made.

Minecraft,Hi Mojang  I have been playing Minecraft since like 2014 or 2015  and even you had the new MCPE controls  I have been using the D-pad and interact controls. It gets irritating now eversince you changed the D-pad controls design because whenever I click at the bottom right between the left and down button  it places or break blocks unintentionally.

Minecraft,The mobile version is great and it works perfectly.

Minecraft,Ok first of all  love Minecraft. But my point  why would you update the controls??? Why out of all things you can change would you change the controls. They have been untouched for years and now you decide to change them. Team should know this was a dumb decision  i get putting it as a new option  but forcing all players to change it permanently is insane  its like asking for sales to drop.

Minecraft,I'm sorry  but why did you change the D-Pad and how it works after the most recent update? Can't you just make a setting where you swap these buttons to the other side of the screen  or at least fix the bug where you can't even go up and down in Creative Mode upon using the Customization Menu?

I also thought leaving the beta would fix the problem where it refuses to show my skin and also signs me out EVERY time I open the stupid game. it won't show my skin unless I'm on Internet and even that takes 10 tries,NEGATIVE,1,0.997605085,21-Apr-24
Minecraft,It's really a hit or miss... They should just actually stop the mob votes and add the mobs that were not picked cause it would be so much fun cause the game gets boring over time and the servers are really glitchy and pay to win. And I feel bad for xbox players cause they cannot even add a custom server so they are forced to play the pay to win & laggy servers.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999776304,22-Apr-24
Minecraft,I bought many add-ons from the shop but the fact having add-ons disable achievements is dumb. Dude you should disable achievements for playing in peaceful not for having add-ons. I have a furniture mod  an animal mod a tamable dragon mod and also an item (some tools like hand held lanterns climbing picks and other stuff) mod. It doesn't sound like cheating. It sounds like stuff you should add.,POSITIVE,0,0.978693604,17-Apr-24
Minecraft,Ok. 1 thing is that I get very annoyed by the fact that everything is so expensive. And now yall JUST wanna add add-ons which made me have to spend up my saving money to get and I had the nerve to have to pay 10 dollars for it.. even Roblox ain't that expensive. 400 is 5 dollars and that can get you a whole bunch of stuff  but here it's cranked up by a whole dollar. And if you have too many worlds  it'll start kicking you and and lagging like crazy. Ngl... I want my money back just for that.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999069512,19-Apr-24
Minecraft,I am so happy with the recent updates.And all the recent stuff haven adding to this. I can finally mod on my phone like how crazy is that?

Minecraft,This is the best game I've played when I first played it on my PC! There are some problems going on and people somehow complain that Microsoft should not have Minecraft.

Minecraft,Pros: it's Minecraft but on your phone Cons: - Requires a third party file browser to access skins stored on device due to a permissions bug - Enchantment glint rendering is broken on android  causing enchanted armour to look really weird - following the UI update  the D-pad controls have a really small  barely usable maximum size - Vibrations can only be turned off when using touch controls  forced on when using a controller,NEGATIVE,1,0.999623775,29-Mar-24
Minecraft,LOTS OF CONSTANT CRASHES! I lost my netherite set cause i keep crashing at my realms. A bed  a chests and double chests  and even banners. Rendering those lags the game alot.

Minecraft,Edit: so the problem for the dissapearing worlds is Android's strict file protection.

Minecraft,Where do I start... My skins still don't load  my marketplace still doesn't load  my realms don't work  I still can't just remove things out of my inventory in creative mode  and now I cannot do quick block breaking in creative mode either.

Minecraft,Changed it to 3 stars due to game stuttering every 10 second and customizability to touch control that doesn't allow you to mapping the touch button all the way to the top of the screen (I'm using 4 claw finger setup) sometimes causing it to not register my button input  perhaps because of the button overlay placed near to each other,NEGATIVE,1,0.99936229,22-Mar-24

Minecraft,Return to the old d-pad the new one does'nt work good the pvp of many players is being affected badly kindly reset to the old d-pad and jump button Or I will beat you up because you guys messed up and if you guys think the players which are good with this new one you should make the option to select d-pads and jump buttons and I am not going to play the game until you fix this,NEGATIVE,1,0.998866796,14-Mar-24

Minecraft,don't get me wrong  I love this game. But I do have one issue. Importing custom Minecraft skins. I don't know why  but Minecraft will sometimes remove my skin from the  dressing room   so I'll try to reupload it and boom  it won't let me.

Minecraft,Google changed me twice trying to download it again on my kids new phone. It was a issue but not refundable. Definitely not paying for anything Minecraft related in this game.

Minecraft,NEW D-PAD CONTROLS ARE NOT USABLE I just updated my game and the original d pad and jump/fly button had been replaced. The new one is unusable.

Minecraft,After playing it since the time the app icon was squared off  i can say i know a little bit.

Minecraft,So  I tried this on my tab A9+. And I also had mods (before and I UNDOWNLOADED IT) And  I tried the original version  which cost money here. It's good!!

Minecraft,So  I have been playing this game for over 7 years now across multiple platforms and I love it  but the reason of the 2 star rating is because after the new update it starts having really bad performance although my phone is fairly powerful and now I get a lot of lag and frame drops and I play with the lowest render distance and the lowest settingsð£,NEGATIVE,1,0.99922204,9-Mar-24

Minecraft,I love this game. Don't get me wrong  this game is good. However it has a lot of glaring flaws. For one  it takes so long to load my realm. It's ridiculous that I have to wait that long to play on a server I pay for. Also the game is very laggy on a lot of devices. I know a lot of this comes down to having a bad device. However it is very hard to enjoy the game when things like exploration are a pain in the butt. So I think the game needs for performance updates.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998355806,15-Mar-24
Minecraft,I was going to go onto my world  I went on  and none of my progress saved. My redstone elevator somehow was cut in half when I rejoined.

Minecraft,Once again changing my review  changing the D-pad was one of the worst things you could've done  like others have said we already had the old controls down by muscle memory  there was nothing wrong with the old one and updating it makes the game unplayable for those who have been playing for years  movement is halted and awkward  the buttons are too far in into the screen and the option to switch between control styles should REALLY be implemented,NEGATIVE,1,0.99970144,27-Mar-24

Minecraft,Great game. I spend hours lost in this game every time I play. However this app keeps lagging out and then closing. It's quite irritating and is grounds to remove the app if it doesn't get fixed. I was super excited to have this game at my fingertips but this is a buzz kill.,NEGATIVE,1,0.993541718,3-Apr-24
Minecraft,Look  to be honest. The updates are either focused towards adding little to no ideas to already existing blocks as due to the development team not agreeing on single ideas they have to implement things separately or if so  none at all. The mob votes are destabilized to the point where now we are getting very dry ideas for new mobs  such as a item holder mob which is basically a living armorstand. Now someone may say   They try their best.  They don't even use full potential when updating.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999530196,7-Feb-24

Minecraft,Good game  played it for years. New updates are great honestly. But I'm giving it 3 stars  why? Because 1: every time I make a new avatar it keeps either deleting  or it just goes back to Alex/Steve when I start playing? And 2: so many of the skin/avatar clothes are for real money. I get that you need money BUT you already get money from people buying this game (over 50mil did so that's a lot already) and features in the game  plus why can't you just make at least Â¼ of the skin clothes free?,NEGATIVE,1,0.979614079,28-Feb-24

Minecraft,The game is all good.

Minecraft,This game is way to harsh for how they describe it as a fun Sandbox with anything able to happen. Yes the best thing to happen so far is I fell in lava with all of my gear on me. AND IT DISSAPEARED. A LITTLE TO HARSH. never playing this game without creative. I got confident in fighting after the wolf update then my wolf died. I got good gear and felt confident in mining and fighting and I died with all of my armour .,POSITIVE,0,0.80641222,29-Apr-24
Minecraft,Minecraft  being really fun has one bug that makes things a bit hard for roleplays with my friends and family. I tried to give a skin to my sister  it was a Minecraft skin that I had played the game with myself she tried to put it on but it didn't count as a Minecraft skin and said  that's not a Minecraft skin  silly.   Other then that the game is awesome!,POSITIVE,0,0.769570649,23-Apr-24

Minecraft,â¨ï¸I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MINECRAFT!â¨ï¸It's probably the best game I have ever played!

Minecraft,Hey  developers  great game. HOWEVER can you fix the newest update. So  whenever I move the camera (the head) around  it does this like vibrate thing  where it vibrates really fast and makes everything blurry when you move your head. It doesn't happen for a few minutes  when you go into the settings (not change anything  just sit in the settings) and then hop back into the game. But then it comes back. It makes the game so nauseous  and hard to play.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996777117,3-Jan-24
Minecraft,Minecraft is fun. I love it. It's very easy to pick up the controls and h to play the game. Mobile is a little harder  but the bigger the better. You can play with your friends and prak em. But the worst update is when they added netherite  it's pointless to me. Very hard to find wouldn't waste like 5 hours just to find. But it at least gives you achievements. But fun in all. Highly recommend.,POSITIVE,0,0.991403401,28-Jan-24
Minecraft,Minecraft is a fun  adventurous game where you could either be surviving in vast lands  or be in creative mode and being able to fly and build whatever you want.

I definitely recommend this game.,POSITIVE,0,0.999378562,13-Jan-24
Minecraft,As a long tem player of minecraft (Since â 2016) I've have never ran into issues until recently. The game overall is good  a bit laggy  but that's expected from a mobile game. My only issue with the game is my inability to change my skin; I've been having this issue for about 3 to 4 months  whenever I find a skin from anywhere it mentions how it's not a skin--even though its the same apps and website. I've just now mentioned it as I thought it would be fixed within a week or two--but it has not.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996084809,6-Jan-24
Minecraft,Great game! Bad execution on mobile. Been playing Java edition for 9+ years  for a few reasons this just can't come close to that. The controls are frankly stupid. Every free mobile game has fully customizable and  good feeling  controls. This just lacks the customization. The game is also pretty poorly optimized  even on a solid phone (S21 with Snap 888) it just experiences random stutters. I love minecraft with a passion  but I can't seem to get any enjoyment out of the mobile port.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999679327,7-Jan-24
Minecraft,It's minecraft  which is a really epic game that now can be played on the convenience of your phone or tablet. I love the portability and the updates that help it compare to the other versions of the game. It's come a long way from just being a  pocket edition   from when I first started playing in 2019. I don't have too many lag issues or problems playing. One thing tho is that it's hard to find the file to a saved world when wanting to import it to a new device. Overall  it's still a fun game,POSITIVE,0,0.997704446,21-Jan-24
Minecraft,The game is amaze! Really! But its potential is not used. We could have a much greater variety of animals  there is so little to do in the end because it is so empty that it becomes a boring dimension  there could be stronger monsters in the overworld  like a giant spider or dragons to fight and make the game more exciting  etc. We only have one (relevant) uptade for year and when it happens  it does not bring big news. The game could be much better than it is now.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999405622,27-Jan-24

Minecraft,I love this game. However after the recent update  it will crash. I can't even get to the home screen before it crashes. It shows the loading screen then right when it should go to the home screen  it crashes! In my personal opinion  I think that if the Minecraft team is working towards the next big update 1.21  they should start working to fix this problem. This problem can cause people to stop playing and what's the point in 1.21  if nobody plays the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998238921,11-Dec-23

Minecraft,I haven't played Minecraft in over 7 months to a year. I was so excited to finally play again and I purchased and downloaded it and made a world to build in. until when I placed blocks  they'd disappear and I'd keep having to build those blocks over and over again for about 4 times in a row. blocks would randomly delete  (the ones I didn't place). along with the villagers and animals weren't moving.

Minecraft,This is an awesome game and I play it every day  but I would enjoy it more if you were to add carriages. Carriages would be a fantastic addition to the game because it could seat seven-eight players  one being in the front controlling the carriage  also there could be one or two horses  two horses would make it faster. This way groups of 3 to 8 could travel on the same transportation device.

Minecraft,Was one of the best games on any platform until the new dpad controls ruined it. I'm leaving this at a 1 star review until they give us back our old buttons. New buttons are horribly spaced. Did they not do any player testing of them before releasing them? And they wiped out all the character's I had created  and the tool to make characters is broken.

Minecraft,The game is great  because  among other things  you can create whatever you want for an infinite about of time  but it is considerably worse than Java Edition and is incredibly buggy  for example when I wear enchanted armor  the texture is spread out over my whole character!

Lately I have been practicing some extreme demons  and sometimes my game crashed because I got out of it to do something  and it sets me all the way back. (And very far back sometimes  same thing happened with me and tidal wave today.) So  just please add a feature where you can return to a previous position.,POSITIVE,0,0.937254846,29-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,After 7 years  2.2 has finally been released and it is amazing! His levels now look very good with his boss fight in the tower. But there is an issue that I saw. In the level editor  when you put ignore damage  you are unable to be hit by anything. But now  I can be hit by blocks  well I can't be hit by the spikes  I ignore that because IDC. But the game is insane. Cool triggers like the zoom and offset. Platformer was the best because you can now move across the map! Highly recommend. /RubRub,POSITIVE,0,0.99895215,30-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,This is probably the most addicting game everr! The songs are catchy  kinda hard but tests your reflexes. Nice game  you can also customize ur character  lots of different skins  you can play other people's creations and make ur own too! This is a great game  no problems  no glitches  bugs  etc. I rate this five stars  hopefully there will be more fun levels!! ððð,POSITIVE,0,0.998719573,30-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,It's nice that 2.2 has finally come out but I have one very big issue. The level editor is bugged. When I come out of the level after saving it and trying to go back in  the game freezes depending on the situation(if you're on the [Edit Play Upload etc] button screen then it will freeze; if you're playing the level and you go into the editor then it shows you the loading screen then freezes. Please fix this. But it's still five stars anyways  second most perfect game ever. Thanks Robtop!(Mobile),NEGATIVE,1,0.964885771,17-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,I really like this game  the music is great  it's frustrating in a good way and it's entertaining as it should be but on Blast Processing at 3% there's a little bug. You see whenever I turn off my phone open on the game it doesn't let me jump there which is really frustrating because I have to get out of the level then go back so I hope you guys can fix it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.965555608,23-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,The game is awesome! I don't regret a single penny i spent on the game but there are some issues.. For an example  the save system is laggy  i have to spam the save button until it saves and it can take up to 5 minutes until it saves. Please fix it. Oh and also  this is not related to the game itself  but you could fix the account management website  there is nothing wrong with it  it's just dull and you could work on it.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998346329,10-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,This game is so fun and challenging!!!and hard. I love it!!!also the music is excellent. Especially for the tower:floor 1 level 2 and 4.but I have a bug:80% of the time if an ad comes or you leave the game to continue you have to press the x button but sometimes there is an ad on top and you can't press it.Hope it get fixed!!other than that it's 5 stars out of 5!!,POSITIVE,0,0.998728573,16-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,This game has a good layer of difficulty  which makes you explore the other features before going back to the main levels. Also  it has an excellent level maker system  and you can get a multitude of secret badges and skins to play as whilst you get better. So overall  the game may be difficult  but that is the best way to teach the mechanics of the game,POSITIVE,0,0.998993695,2-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,Great  but when I bought the game  it looks like I have the older version of the full game. I'm disappointed that I'm unable to experience the newest update because of my device  kinda. EDIT: Now that the 2.2 update is out  I HAD A BLAST PLAYING DASH AND PLATFORMER LEVELS! The REAL problem is when I play some levels  there's a super small chance that it cuts to the further level  like if I just play the levels normally then out of nowhere I got teleported further and ended up dying. What's wrong,NEGATIVE,1,0.99952805,10-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,A beautifully crafted level with mesmerizing visuals and a captivating soundtrack. The gameplay is challenging yet fair  offering a rewarding experience for players of all skill levels. The level design seamlessly integrates with the music  creating an immersive journey that keeps players engaged from start to finish. With its creative obstacles and smooth gameplay mechanics   Lost in Dreams  is a true,POSITIVE,0,0.999877691,12-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,The game is super fun  and I love the challenging levels and secrets  but I'm having a few issues  though. 1. It doesn't save all of my progress today. I got the cat cube and a different type of rocket/ship  but when I came back on the game later  they were locked again 2. I have unlocked the chamber of secrets and the gauntlets  but I can't use them. I've tried searching why they don't work  but still nothing it's really difficult cause I would just like to get the keys to the dungeon!!!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.991701543,28-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,A great game  but it's not yet a fun experience especially when it comes to extra online content  i.e. custom levels. It takes a lot of grinding to get new  skins  to customize your character  though it doesn't impact your overall experience. With lots of content currently here  I think something must be done to incentivize new players  and give them new sets of easy custom levels to play on Map Packs. Again  game's not fun yet  but it's wonderful and great.,POSITIVE,0,0.99556607,14-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,The best GD game I have played. Levels are fun to replay (although I most commonly play  Dash  because it has 2.2 stuff). The level editor? I don't even have to explain why it's so great. I do have one issue and it's that trying to use complicated is a nightmare  but hey what did I expect  2.2 was in development for nearly 7 years. 10/10,POSITIVE,0,0.99023062,7-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,Been playing this game across devices for over 9Â½ years. It is one of the greatest games of all time  and the greatest investments I've ever made. Some tips: don't jump to the hardest levels right away  and don't be afraid to use practice mode to learn the levels you'd like to play. We all start somewhere  and don't expect to be victorious every attempt. This game has challenges for every skill level of playerâ you'll find something to suit your skill as you go from beginner to professional. :),POSITIVE,0,0.999637842,10-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,I've been playing since late 2.0 early 2.1  and I haven't stopped since. This is one of my favorite games of ALL time. Limitless level creation potential  MILLIONS of custom levels to play  very fun main levels showing off the game's progression from the updates  the new Platformer mode  just EVERYTHING is amazingly done. Except for the Map Packs. The only downside.,POSITIVE,0,0.999544322,12-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,My favourite game of all time. 1000/10 Edit: 2.2 is out after 6 years! Now I can say it with more confidence. This is hands down the best game humanity has ever seen. Ever. It gives challenging levels  a seemingly limitless editor  hundreds of thousands of fun and beautiful levels  has a HUGE skill cap  achievements that are hard but really rewarding  and much more. Definitely the most fun and complete game I've been able to enjoy.,POSITIVE,0,0.999796927,12-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,I played geometry dash lite for about 3 months  and when I got the full version  I instantly LOVED it! It has way more features than the lite version  including no ads  the ability to play other people's levels  make levels  and have access to so much more. This is definitely worth getting  and I highly recommend if u like geometry dash. 10/10 ð,POSITIVE,0,0.999690294,27-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,Tried the Lite version  loved it! Bought the full version  music sounds tinnier  like it's coming out of the earpiece instead of the main speaker. And obviously the music is a huge part of the experience on this game  so this is a big deal! Also I can't load my progress after setting up an account in Lite and logging in on full version. Less of an issue as I can just play through the game again.,NEGATIVE,1,0.995581567,14-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,The 2.2 update is amazing. The level Dash is so cool  and with a bit of practice it's way easier than any other insane level like Finger dash or even harder ones like Jumper. I like that with a bit of practice you can get better and better  not like those other unfair platformers that don't let you pass whatever you do. The practice mode is perfect  the editor is a tad bit wacky  I don't know what half the editor does  and the mirror portals won't work  but the overall game is close to perfect.,POSITIVE,0,0.999667406,19-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,WOW! This game is amazing. I'm a senior in highschool and I still play it. I love challengeing myself to harder levels and watching the game's community grow. And 2.2 just made everything better! A few concerns though; the ship at 70% in Dash is extremely laggy (otherwise I would've already beaten it)  and also smooth fix occasionally chickens out and decides to not work. Still giving 5* though because DUH!,NEGATIVE,1,0.978424311,14-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,I always loved geometry dash ! I played it when I was just a kid. When I recently remembered about this game I immediately purchased this again to play. I also love the new level called  Dash . It was so creative and challenging. This will always be forever part of my gaming journey. I really highly recommend this if you want to play something challenging while vibing to upbeat musics.,POSITIVE,0,0.99984169,29-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,This game is top tier for a simple tapping game  the editor is easy to use until triggers  plenty of levels to choose from  and more. There are a few things that could be added/bugfixed; 1. A searchbar in the editor for a certain object your looking for 2. The 3 button thing in platformer levels actually working (it could just be me). The community of Geometry Dash also has plenty of stuff to talk  argue  and hate or love on in Geometry Dash. Thank you for an amazing game Robert Topalað¤¨!,POSITIVE,0,0.990982354,3-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,Amazing game. The new platformer mode adds a whole new twist to the normal moving right only mode  and that makes it 10 times better. You can also access community made levels that can be really challenging. On the RobTop made levels  there are no really similar levels  and they all vary in difficulty. There are also collectible secret coins that are very well placed. Amazing job  RobTop. Love this game â¤ï¸,POSITIVE,0,0.999707878,3-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,Great game  it's just so that I cannot really play online and get the 3 hr/daily chests. This is an issue  because I also have an account but I cannot access it because of some  bug  happening with the internet. The thing I find frustrating in this event is I have perfect wifi and I also have unlimited mobile data. Other than that  this is a 4 star game for now  and I will rate it back up if this glitch has either stopped or you have fixed it for samsung. Thank you Rob!,NEGATIVE,1,0.976182461,27-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,Absoloutely amazing. Been playing it for a long time and now that 2.2.13 is out  it's just gotten better and better. However I only have 1 problem whenever I play  its when I'm saving my data. Sometimes it doesn't work and causes me to lose lots of progress  this is only real problem I have with GD and hopefully it's fixed soon!,NEGATIVE,1,0.996956944,17-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,I LOVE the new 2.2 update  especially  Dash  and the camera effects. The Tower is awesome  the levels are well-designed  but there's quite a big problem with the editor: I don't know if it's just for me  but when I click the Edit button on an unshared level it freezes. Also  if I press Play  the game enters the loading screen but most of the time it freezes. Would have given this game 5 stars  but these 2 bugs make me almost always have to remake a layout. Hope this gets fixed  I love GD! ðð¼ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.996120632,8-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,2.2 is revolutionary! The new platformer levels are amazingly fun to play  and Moons are quickly becoming a relaxing  fun way to play the game! However I've encountered my first bug. When verifying a level and you die mid-way through  sometimes the song doesn't restart with the level and winds up continuing. Sometimes it fixes itself and stops if you play a certain distance through the level  but it almost always happens. You can manually fix it though  by pressing the restart button,POSITIVE,0,0.897779942,24-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,7 years...Soo worth the wait  I love it! My only problem is the level editor  when I try to open my levels/the level I'm working on the game just freezes  it stops responding and crashes afterwards. If I create a new level it enters the editor but I can only access that specific level's editor a couple of times before it starts acting up like the other levels. I play on mobile (Honor 90 lite 5G) Please fix this  I'm probably not the only one who struggles with this it's obnoxious and frustrating,NEGATIVE,1,0.999537468,12-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Learning curve is medium to high  difficulty level is limitless. And you need a lot of practice to actually get good at it. The most frustrating thing is when even after hundreds of attempts you can't beat the level  and it's hard to stop playing it until you actually complete it. At some point it feels like it's not enjoyable anymore  you just wanna complete it somehow. So yeah  even though it's an amezing and unique game  it can be really addictive and frustrating.,NEGATIVE,1,0.977044582,25-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Glad it has finally updated to 2.2! Though it became much more laggy on my phone-still  it's cool. The reason why I only rated it as a four is because the Rocketship Mode has changed it seems. It like  became much lighter to tap  or maybe it's just my imagination. But before  it was heavier to the touch  which made it easier for me to control the ship  especially if the level has tight passages or if the ship changes into a small size version. Still  it's fun to play with the new version.,POSITIVE,0,0.997644007,23-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,I've been playing Geometry Dash for a couple years now and I really love the game. However there is a bug with Scratch's Shop in 2.2. I got 500 diamonds  but every time I attempt to access his shop  it doesn't let me. I'm guessing this is a bug and hopefully it's fixed soon as you can't progress further with the demon guardian! The also seems to be an issue with the saving saying that the data is (2.69/0.00)  which makes no sense as I don't have any created levels. Please fix this soon. Thx,NEGATIVE,1,0.997913897,15-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Great game with alot of secret and challenges  plus alot of levels! But there are a few bugs  first bug is it resets your data randomly  I logged in today to see my whole progress wiped  the tower  the levels  even the icons were wiped And in Dash  the ship part is buggy  but other than that the game is amazing! I'll be waiting for those things to get fixed!,POSITIVE,0,0.610093355,31-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,Really awesome game  especially with the new 2.2 update. There are so many different achievements and icons to get and so many levels to play. The level editor is very good  although a few bugs exist  like where if you add a middle ground to your level  it becomes impossible to open in the editor  and that you can still die to blocks and slopes in the editor even if you have ignore damage on.,POSITIVE,0,0.999180973,8-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Game is very fun  with both beginner friendly levels  and levels so hard you wonder if they are humanly possible. Lil' square boi is surprisingly customizable too. One thing I would have liked  though is to transfer my data from the free versions. Edit: Have had save data issues for years. Local save keeps reverting to an earlier version and I have to load my cloud save every time I play. Lame because sometimes I forget to save + I can't play offline. Thought 2.2 would fix this but it didn't.,POSITIVE,0,0.824919641,29-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,2.2 is GREAT! Everything from the main levels to the community to the levels creators such as Subwoofer and Serponge could create! There's been one issue on my end where everytime I open the game after it was closed  I have to sign back into my account. That's been pretty annoying  but I'll get over it eventually. Other than that  BEST. UPDATE. EVER. 100% worth 7 years of waiting. Edit: The problem fixed itself,NEGATIVE,1,0.991476119,30-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,I like the game  it is fun  challenging and great but I wish they would just add this simple yet important feature   autosave progress . There are times where I had to redownload the app and I forget about the save feature and I lose my 9 months of progress. I have lost some demons and alot of other stuff due to this issue  I hope Robtop adds this feature and make the game just a bit better,NEGATIVE,1,0.99684298,4-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,It's an enjoyable game  but I keep experiencing a save issue. Randomly  after closing the game and opening it again  It reverses actions I make in my game and sometimes makes me lose items  which goes from stuff I buy in the shops  to chests in the treasure room  and to other rewards in the game  and I end up having to buy/get it again. This bug doesn't always happen  but it's still annoying to deal with.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994035959,1-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,I originally started with the lite version. It wasnt until I beat all of the lite levels ls that I wanted to upgrade. However when that time came  the play store no longer allowed it's download. However by this time  it wasnt long until 2.2 came out and I could download it. I'm loving the level editor and the new robtop ones I have access to. Just  remember to save often. I made that mistake.,POSITIVE,0,0.55852288,31-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,This game is the true GOAT of its kind. The main levels are fairly easy  but the coins provide fun challenges  and the access to player-made levels keeps it from ever getting dull. Just one thing though- on the first coin for Electroman Adventures  there's a bug that prevents your character from breaking the breakable barrier sometimes. Kind of annoying.,NEGATIVE,1,0.970840573,21-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,2.2 is out  and it is very VERY good. There are two glitches though that I find quite annoying. The first of which is the glitch in breakable blocks. Sometimes the block acts like a normal basic block and you restart when you hit it  instead of the normal breaking. The second of which is in editor mode  the option to ignore damage no longer works. You can pass through spikes easily  but walls  slopes  and sometimes sawblades will kill you even while no damage is on. Please fix this.,NEGATIVE,1,0.751323223,28-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,I love it! I play every game  and only one bug I found. When I'm dashing with the arrows and supposed to stop dashing  I can keep going (and that's intentional so you have to time yourself) but when you have a part in the level after this there's the blue jump pad on the ground and walls (like in  the challenge ) you can glitch out of the map and sometimes skip part of the level. Maby robtop can add a feature to the level builder so you can customize how long you can dash with them.,NEGATIVE,1,0.983862579,23-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Best platformer/rythm game I have ever played. You can play harder levels for hardcore players  and easier levels for casual players. Grinding is optional  and only done by players who cares about their place in the leaderboard and currencies in the game. Very replayable as almost 90% of the levels are made by the community  with levels unique every search. With the addition of 2.2  user made levels will only get better. The gameplay gets repetitive sometimes.,NEGATIVE,1,0.880231142,29-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,Awesome game! But the platformer mode needs a bit of tweaking. In the cursed thorn boss fight  a got to phase 3 and the boss wouldn't attack  so the only way i could get out of that softlock is by jumping into the lava. The end trigger either doesn't work or i don't know how to use it despite watching 3 videos on how to use the thing  and if you hold right for too long  your character moves right on it's own until you put in an input. Still an awesome game though!,NEGATIVE,1,0.812804103,20-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Really great game it's a lot of trial and error but that's what gives Geometry dash it's shine and the more levels you complete the more fun it is. Would HIGHY recommend! Bug I found as of 12/28/23 when you spend a lot of time in the editor making a level it tends to glitch out and become stuck on the loading screen forcing you to exit the app and re open it and when you try to go back in the level editor it just freezes the game meaning you can't finish your level this glitch needs fixing.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994907796,28-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,Geometry Dash is a fun rhythm-based platformer game  with the simplest controls for easy fun! In the classic mode of the game  all you do is tap/hold the screen to avoid obstacles in an autoscrolling level. It's not as bad as other autoscrolling platformers  in fact it's the best one I've played and is actually just great fun! At first  it's hard but with more practice you'll get better and better. It's really addicting and definitely worth the small price.,POSITIVE,0,0.9998281,24-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Hey Robtop! So  2.2 came out. What do I think? ABSOLUTELY AWESOME! Though I have encountered some glitches. 1. In the Vault of Secrets  entering 'The Challenge' in any way will not make the level accessible  thus making it impossible to get into the Chamber of Time. 2. Sometimes when playing custom levels  the progress bar will fill up faster than you actually finish the level. 3. People have reported that they cannot access Scratch's Shop. There's also a bug in Dash. I hope 2.21 fixes these. â,NEGATIVE,1,0.991871715,27-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,Very challenging and fun! It makes you want to keep going. It keeps count of your deaths and percentage to the end. Unless that's the other Geometry Dash games. ;) My son is also obsessed with this game and shouts with excitement! If this tells you anything. There is also some neat music and the graphics are very colorful and appealing to the eye.,POSITIVE,0,0.999824107,21-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,2.2 is here and OH MY GOD I LOVE IT The platformer mode is amazing (although I thought arrows would look different for movement) and the new level is kinda great! Kind of. Whenever you're at the countdown  and turn into the ship  since I play mobile  it's very laggy  and I can't get past the ship part after countdown. Please fix this. I put hours of practice into Dash just to not be able to finish. Please fix it!!!,POSITIVE,0,0.978215277,25-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,I love how nostalgic this app is  and 2.2 is awesome! One problem I have with it though is Dash. I play on a Moto G Power phone  which is a pretty recent phone  and I lag like crazy at 70-76% on Dash. It scuffs my run  and I've managed to make it there so many times. I would like it to be fixed so I could beat the level. Also  since I have a newer account  when I unlocked the vault  I couldn't unlock the Challenge  and thus cannot progress  and cannot unlock the Gatekeeper as well,NEGATIVE,1,0.991171539,8-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Really sick(awesome in this case)! Been waiting for years for this to be released on my phone  and 2.2 is so worth it. The best I can say is to look around and explore the secrets yourself. Some glitches happen though  where the cursed thorn boss will softlock and just float around the screen  and saving sometimes doesn't work. And how the mobile platform mode checkpoints don't work. 9/10. Super great!!,POSITIVE,0,0.993536413,2-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,(Edited as of 2.2) The 2.2 update is here  with a great new level thats sight-readable  something I thought I would be an issue with this level  but alas! Very fun! The changes to the editor have been quite substantial  with new tracks and many new possibilites  which is amazing! But still  biggest issue are Map Packs- they aren't fun and consist of outdated levels. The lists seem cool  but just not that fun. Wished for more this update  but I understand the delays- well done RobTop! :),NEGATIVE,1,0.955233574,22-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,I would find that geometry dash is a game that has many things that allow anyone to enjoy. It's a thoroughly thought out game that features many gamemodes that many people can enjoy while playing levels as you listen to the music. There was however some issues with the  practice mode  not allowing me to finish a level completely. Other than that  it's a fulfilling experience.,POSITIVE,0,0.999605715,11-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,I've been playing since 2.0  which would seem fairly new  but is actually half of the game's lifespan so far  and the game has only gotten better  except for one thing... My rating would be 5 stars  but I have one small issue with 2.2. While being the biggest update in the game's history  some of my 2.2 levels won't open back into the editor  and instead  the app crashes and I have to restart it. Please fix this is 2.21. (Also I'm hyped for 2.21 so 2.2 is complete  and hopefully this is fixed.),NEGATIVE,1,0.999586403,20-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,Geometry Dash was already an amazing game to begin with  but update 2.2 made it even better with the amount of new stuff they added. As for the game itself  it's simple but deceptively difficult. As it is a rhythm game  you platform through side-scrolling levels as a cube  ship  ball  UFO  wave  spider  and now recently  a swing copter. Each of these gamemodes has a different kind of gameplay style  which makes it varied. Very fun. 2.2 also added platformer levels  which are also great.,POSITIVE,0,0.999372423,21-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,been playing since very late 2013  it's a beauty of a game. just perfect in every single way  and now with 2.2 the possibilities are endless  want to make a mini-game about robbing a train? go for it. want to re-make sc:go in here? go crazy. do it. want to just make a good old classic level? go ahead. want to make a adventure-themed style platformer? yeah do it  want to make friends? well... that one is maybe too far  but either way  it's lovely,POSITIVE,0,0.996791661,22-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,Geometry Dash 2.2. Update is nice! I have seen a bug where when there is a time warp trigger  and you die in practice mode  the time warp stops working. I've also seen an issue with the song trigger. Basically when you hit the trigger and die  the song is still playing. I also suggest adding back the option  Turn off shake effects  and adding  Disable shader effects.  Overall  this update is amazing just that you might need to iron out the bugs.,POSITIVE,0,0.997336209,8-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,There is a bug where I chose the third mid ground thing  then I played my level to see if it looks good  but suddenly when I go back to the editor  for some reason I can't access the editor it just says  loading  and I really wish if you focus on this cuz some players will lose there progress of there level  I'm still trying to figure out how  but please fix this I can't lose my 5 years progress on my level!!!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.998816252,26-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,This game is very fun  and even addicting at times. The editor is surprisingly capable  and the levels are very creative. However  it seems to delete my progress every time I close the app. This is very annoying to deal with  and I believe it's because the game insists of installing to my micro SD card (Geometry Dash doesn't save to external storage  I don't think) and this is the only thing holding this game back.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996746778,6-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,The update is really cool  although there is some problems. The new main level  Dash  is extremely unoptimized for low to mid devices. Also the Platformer mode is also sort of broken and it freezes or just strait up crashes mid gameplay. In creating Platformer levels (Idk if its in normal mode too)  the levels become inaccessible in a few minutes of making it. Possibly making the game freeze when I try to access the level I recently created. I would rate higher if the issues I mentioned fixed.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99949491,22-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,The game progressively gets harder and it is legendary. You start of with stereo madness  the first level  where you learn the mechanics of geometry dash. Once you get 500 orbs  which you get from beating levels  you are able to unlock skins that are pretty cool. You can play platformer levels which have great mechanics that I really like. Finally  you can create your own level in the create menu. Overall  geometry dash will be a game you will go on when you need to rest after a long day.,POSITIVE,0,0.999474585,25-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,Really enjoyable  personally I am not the best at the game but it doesn't change the fact that this game is really fun.. I mean there is a lot of challenge in it but that's what the game is   a cube that jumps around dodging obstacles. There's only one thing I don't like it's the 2.2 update  I mean like it breaks every rule that was established in the main levels. Example in 2.2 you can stick to ceilings but in the games rules you usually couldn't. A part from that it's a really fun game.,POSITIVE,0,0.997051001,2-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,Been playing the game for over 2 years now. It's quite decent for a music-based platformer. Spent most of my time in the level editor creating levels and the editing mechanics are somehow simple. Well of course it isn't as easy as it might sound but you'll get used to it eventually. Overall  despite having some bugs  it's pretty solid. And for those who say the game is too hard  just take some time improving your skills and trust me it'll not be as hard as it is before. Goodluck!,POSITIVE,0,0.999135315,20-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,Geometry Dash is a gaming gem that seamlessly marries simplicity and challenge. With its intuitive controls  it welcomes players of all levels  but don't be fooled â the escalating difficulty keeps the adrenaline pumping. Visually mesmerizing  the game's geometric landscapes are a treat for the eyes. The soundtrack is a rhythmic masterpiece  enhancing the overall experience. Regular updates ensure continued excitement  making it a timeless favorite.,POSITIVE,0,0.999866843,20-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,Geometry dash is a very fun game  where you can play levels  customize skins  play online and even play other levels people have made! This game is one of my favorites  but there is one... ONE problem. When I save my data  currently for me it says  Backup failed  0.00 (0.00/0.00)   but it doesn't really bother me.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998192132,18-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,This game is quite fun and is good for when I'm bored. But I do have one issue. I think 2.2 was rushed so there are a lot of bugs. One of them is the middle ground is making my level crash when I try to edit it. Another one is in the vault of secrets it won't let me play the challenge. One last issue I have is it won't let me create an account and it just says failed to creat account. Again its a great game but I would love if these bugs were fixed,NEGATIVE,1,0.995942295,9-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,So I personally love Geometry Dash. I've been playing it around the time 2.1 came out. I love the music  sound design and all that jazz. It has fun gameplay too. The editor is great but for some reason I have one level in the editor that I cannot open for some reason. I was just trying to make a new 2.2 platformer level since the update released 4/5 days ago. Its a fun update but I have a few gripes with it. This glitch is making me mad and I dont know what to do. I literally cant open the level,NEGATIVE,1,0.968146384,24-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,It's a great game! But it has three star-killing bugs. 1. In the editor the background looks gray Al the time and 2 and over colors are way off. Like if 2 was blue  it would look lbg yellow in the editor. 2. The music slowly de syncs with the level. 3. Sometimes the taps don't register. Edit: Turns out I had preview mode off. And I can just restart the level while I'm playing it in order to make it sync. (2.2 is out I'm shaking rn),NEGATIVE,1,0.998990476,20-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,Game is good  hooray for 2.2 being here  but whenever I try to make a level  it goes like this; 1. Start making level 2. Level seems good/ I wanna test it 3. Press the play button in the editor 4. Ok  cool  lemme see how this looks in the actual game! 5. Press save and play 6. Ok  it works  lemme continue editing 7. Game freezes Idk if this is new or if it's common  but it's weird and needs to be fixed either way. Thanks Rob ðð,NEGATIVE,1,0.645462871,11-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,I like this game. I think it's pretty hard. It's a 2d game where you are a cube and make your way from obstacles. I love the 2.2 update. Incept hacks Robtop should take down those sites. I get it's fun using hacks but like the space UK incident. We can't tell hacks or what's not. I'm superiesed you can keep this game alive!!!? You should get it. Millions of levels. You can make your levels. So much more in the full version.,POSITIVE,0,0.995890856,29-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,It may seem like a simple impossible game clone  but it is so much more. Geometry dash is a game where you tap the screen to make a constantly moving cube jump to avoid spikes and hitting blocks  the game truly gets interesting here because the game features many different gamemodes that change how the game functions the list includes; the cube  default gamemode that jumps on input  the ship  tap and hold the screen to make the ship boost up  and let go for the ship to fall down. Oh review 2 big,POSITIVE,0,0.997877598,9-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,The best game ever. I love this game - the fun challenge of trying to beat a new level  or the feeling you get when you beat a demon. I love the fact that this game is hard  but not in a rage-y way; it has great progression. I adore the fact that you can make your own levels  and I love the new 2.2 features. My favourite game and I keep on coming back for more. Keep it up RubRub!!,POSITIVE,0,0.999776423,15-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,A good offline game. Lots of things to do. But there is one thing.... JUMPER! Jumper has very bad music. (Trust me it will get on your nerves.) When you are in the tunnel with red background you have 0.00000000000000000001 milisecond to react. Also please don't play the free games. They are awful. Overall it's great with 2.2.,POSITIVE,0,0.687818825,1-May-24
Geometry Dash,It's a good game but it's really simple and I like hard things like boss fight and hard controls because I'm not scared of a game I don't like is that some things are blocked off and geometry dash nothing is blocked off except for open world I think this will be helpful for beginners but if you've already played the game then it won't be that helpful but it might be a little. Like I said I like it and that's why I rated it 5,POSITIVE,0,0.985463142,23-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,Amazing game  huge variety and wildly challenging no matter what you're doing (which is tons of fun for me but I understand not everyone likes to be pushed so hard) and is totally deserving of 5 stars  I only gave it 4 though because this update that we waited so long for has too many bugs. I cannot ever save or load my data and some of my progress gets randomly removed after hours of working for a demon level. I also found a glitch where you can skip levels entirely on mobile.,NEGATIVE,1,0.987217605,2-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,2.2 is awesome! This is the most well designed game of its type. Love the gameplay  and there is so much to do even after completing the included levels. The community levels are amazing  and the new features with 2.2 are so cool! Can't wait to see where else this game goes! Keep up all the great work  Robtop! One thing I would like to see is a multi-player feature  but it seems like that might be in the works with the  versus  mode. Would definitely recommend this game to a friend.,POSITIVE,0,0.999829888,22-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,||| I've been playing this game for years now  but the new level  Dash  is very laggy for me on the ship part and in other parts aswell and for some other people too with devices that are slow. So I have a suggestion  what if adding a low detailed option on the levels like on other online levels that have that option. Also one more thing  I can't save my data on my cloud storage for some reason :< ||| Anyways love the new update 2.2! :>,NEGATIVE,1,0.998099029,2-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,This game is really good  better than the lite version (of course) and I really enjoy it! I have experienced many glitches  although they get patched... right? It has many things to do  finding levels  making levels  uhhhhhh  uhhhh  yeah. Although it may cost money  it's worth it (kinda). Edit: After 2.2 this game is simply perfect,POSITIVE,0,0.999766052,28-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,When i installed gd  i thought it was a good game. But  after beating stereo madness  i had fun. But the problem is  after i beat can't let go. When i played jumper  there was a lot of bugs. Sometimes  when i jumped  it did not sense anything. When i didn't  it did. Geometry Dash  RubRub  Robtop  please fix these bugs. Overall  a good game,POSITIVE,0,0.995190978,13-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,This is very fun. More levels than the lite version and the fact that it does cost money but also only $2 for a mobile game like that is not much for a mobile game on Google play store. And my favorite part is that there are no adds at all and it even comes with a level editer so you can make you own level but you do need a account for it. And also I would give this a five star but it is very hard on mobile so you should download this on PC because it is much easier than Mobile.,NEGATIVE,1,0.96829021,13-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,I've been waiting for this update ngl but there is a problem some online levels are kinda broken the gameplay is alright but example the level Change of scene looks odd like objects isn't in the right place. And the editor whenever I try to rotate a spike it doesn't connects with the grid anymore and I would need to copy and paste it instead of using swipe mode but overall it's 3 times more fun to build a level with so much options to create.,NEGATIVE,1,0.98667556,22-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,It's good and the levels and quality are amazing  but one thing that's off that when you use the fireball animation and press the  disable shine   right after I save and play  it doesn't disable the shine  I checked and it says I didn't check  disable shine   i kept trying and trying and it didn't work  i think it's a bug of something so they should get that bug fixed.,NEGATIVE,1,0.991757333,28-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,A very fun and addictive game. I once showed this to my friends and let them try it  pretty soon  they were now playing this AMAZING game. But when I logged on to 2.2  I sadly  unknowingly  lost 7 demons  I don't really care  but for those newbies  they can't beat those demons that they lost faster. And as a mobile player  I want you to add FPS changer in mobile as well! And maybe even higher graphics. It's unfair that only PC players can change their FPS. Overall  pretty well-made game.,POSITIVE,0,0.988714755,8-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,This game is challenging but rewarding  I still remember beating time machine after a few weeks of struggling  and was so happy  that was the most memorable experience for me playing this game. Also  the level of variety of ways to play is absolutely insane  they have different gamemodes  millions of levels  you can even create your own level and publish it for people to play. Overall this game is a fat W.,POSITIVE,0,0.999667048,12-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,I have such fond memories of playing this game both on my phone and then on PC later on  but when I upgraded my phone to a Pixel I was sad to hear it wasn't supported anymore cause of the Pixel only supporting certain architecture. I'm glad to hear that with 2.2 it's now updated and I can finally play it on my phone. One downside is that certain unlocks are only for online/user created levels  which is unfortunate for those who do not have Internet access. Other than that a very well made game.,POSITIVE,0,0.933303773,23-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,I love this game I've played it for years  but in 2.205  there is a bug where if you playtest in the editor  and stop at the same time a song trigger starts  then the music from the song trigger plays without you playtesting! And mirror portals make Practice Mode Hitboxes disappear  other than that  this game is really good  5 stars. ð,NEGATIVE,1,0.723513246,1-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,Don't listen to all the other reviews  this is a great game  all the nitpicks people have about it can be fixed by either getting a better phone or just figuring out how the game actually works  like how someone said their level progress keeps resetting. The fix to that is that in the account page in game there is a literal button to save your account progress that you need to press before logging out your account  then when you log back in press  load  and it will load the data you saved. 10/10,NEGATIVE,1,0.997723401,21-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,There is a bug that when I am in platformer mode and I move forward  it keeps moving even though I'm not pressing the button. Please fix this because I can't play a level and get a high score with this bug. Febuarary 10. Found more bugs. The percentage bar is very broken. I could spawn in the middle of a level with a start pose  and it will say I'm at 0%. Even after I beat the level  the percentage bar keeps moving until 100%. Also  sometimes  when I die on a level  the music keeps going.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999219656,10-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,The game is awesome. From the main levels  to the awesome new levels people are making. It's full of challenges  but that's whats good about it. And I understand that 2.2 has taken a while  but that just means Robtop is preparing a great update for us. In other words  I would definitely recommend this game to many. P.S. - Omg 2.2 is actually awesome (just please fix the middle ground),POSITIVE,0,0.999749601,6-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,5 stars. I love this game! 2.2 Came out at the end of last year and the levels are awesome! There are a few bugs tho  such as scratch shop not opening  and the challenge. Can't wait until 2.21 with Explorers! Also  where FPS is bypass for mobile  my pc is 75hz XD. Also MDK finally is available on GD. Don't think you get the full music tho. Press start had the subzero level music instead:( overall  great game! Just beat Deadlocked  next demon in B(by motleyorc)  beating demons is so satisfying.,POSITIVE,0,0.996448278,18-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,I've played this game since nine circles and fairydust were considered the top levels. I've enjoyed every hour I've played on both PC and mobile  until this update. PC is fine  but mobile has some sort of delayed touch and it's mad annoying. My hardest level on mobile is future funk ll and I can't even beat the first part of platinum adventure. These levels are nowhere near close in skill level and I'm not sure if it's the phone I have that is causing this or the game. I have a T-Mobile REVVL 6x,NEGATIVE,1,0.997456968,17-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,I love this game. Super fun and lots of variety. I know you have to make money somehow but please make the full version free ð I would give 5 stars but there are a few bugs with the update like the icon jumping when I don't tap the screen  it's really anoying and its making me struggle with even some easier levels. Please fix but other than that amazing game,NEGATIVE,1,0.9354105,24-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,I can't believe 2.2 is finally out  but there are of course some issues as all updates do  such as at 67% on the new level called  dash  the game turns very laggy and makes my inputs very late  I don't know if this is a problem with my phone or something but it would be great if you could fix it  thank you for releasing the new update though  ill have lots of fun figuring out what the hell all these new things do!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999706566,20-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,Epic update  can't stop finding new things to do in it. But there's an issue which is annoying: rotating/flipping an object that isn't exactly 1x1 in the editor rotates the object around its center instead of the 1x1 center. I'm not sure this is intentional or not  but it is a bit frustrating to deal with when it happens.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997811615,22-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,This game is so much fun! All the new updates are very amazing  the new platforms mode  and the new icons. Thank you  robtop  for your your hard work  even if it took a long time. Edit: Robtop  boomlings  I can't get my account registered so I can save my progress. Please fix this  cause I've emailed you twice already. This is now a 4 star game. I will put on back up once you fix this.,POSITIVE,0,0.999538541,1-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,The game and everything else is really great but there is 2 issues with the new 2.2 update. 1. After unlocking an icon or completing a level  Once you re-open the game  anything that you have unlocked or completed just gets wiped from your save. 2. In the new  Dash  level  once you get around to 60% - 70%  The game lags like crazy  from 60fps to 2fps in a singular second.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998733342,10-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Best game ever I started a club where I play it with friends. Quite confused on how to use the Swingcopter though and I think it is quite a hard gamemode. Over all  the level builder is so much fun and interesting as you learn how to use triggers and portals. Some great online levels and the new tower is really fun and challenging. A great selection of well made levels. A fun game to play when in a boring situation. Heavily recommend.,POSITIVE,0,0.999135077,2-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,The new 2.2 update is PHENOMENAL though I really think you should quickly release the bugfixes for it. For some reason I can't login with ANY email and I've just been grinding on an accountless GD. The lever creator also has problems for some reason  at times once you save and exit  you can no longer edit the level again and the screen just gets blacked out forever until the game is restarted and even after restarting I just can no longer work on it which really sucks. Please fix this quick.,NEGATIVE,1,0.998911858,21-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Great game! I really love all new 2.2 futures! Very nice for all ages. Highly recommend! But there is one issue: you cant put middle grounds because the game will crash. Ps.: The new 200 pages editor guide by ViPriN and *i dont remember this name* is really cool. So if you don't understand the triggers then just read it. Pps.: The issue when you can't load (and the game crashes when u try to) data on mobile gets fixed when you reinstall the game.,NEGATIVE,1,0.970879436,13-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,Now with 2.2  this game has upgraded to something better then a fricking game engine! Dash is absolutely amazing  but it's really buggy and somewhat overused shaders. One feature I recommend adding is an orange orb that functions like a spider orb  but doesn't change your gravity. Also I recommend editing the key frame system so it can be a bit smoother  so we could make a roller coaster. Great game!,NEGATIVE,1,0.867933869,5-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Absolutely perfect  2.2 has been amazing so far and I genuinely want to thank RobTop for putting so much effort into making sure the update turned out perfect. There is one complaint though  the ship part at 70% on Dash lags a lot on my phone  making it very hard for me to complete the level  it would be nice if there was some work done on the level's optimization for 2.21. Everything else is absolutely perfect though and this game is still my favorite game of all time. Keep up the good work.,POSITIVE,0,0.999260604,20-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,1. This is amazing! But the level  Dash  is laggy. It lags at 69% (because of triggers) But atleast I beated it. 2. Whenever I'm in the editor after I test it in the editor  The screen freezes and I have to exit/save and play/save and exit And enter again. I didn't actually want to rate this 3 stars.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997805297,29-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,So far I love 2.2  but there's a small issue. I play on mobile and that makes it hard for my device to play dash. It lags a lot but only in the part after 3 2 1. Everything else runs fine. Is there any way that you could add LDM to main levels? But the game itself is really good. Definitely deserves 5 stars! ð,POSITIVE,0,0.999279439,25-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,Theres a certain bug that crashes the game when you use any middleground  I can't even load or continue creating my level anymore  whenever i go press the edit button on my custom map  it crashes in just 20 seconds or so  You should fix this issue right now  maybe its just me  if so then just ignore this review  good update and game overall :),NEGATIVE,1,0.999757826,7-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,Even without 2.2  this game was insanely fun to play because of all of the unique levels and the way people somehow program it  even with limited resources. So when 2.2 came out  it just made it so much better  including the Dash level  which was fun with the camera rotation and movement! In all  this is more then just a decent game  it's enjoyable for even such a simple game idea,POSITIVE,0,0.999287426,30-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Very good game  some bugs  like either not registering inputs or double-clicking and killing you  but overall  very good game. (Edit: since 2.2 came out I have played the game more and more  and it just keeps getting better with new vault codes and secrets  plenty of new icons  whole new gamemode  new levels  platformer mode  and much more.),POSITIVE,0,0.999495864,16-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,So this is a great game  which is why I'm rating it four stars. I would give it a five star review  but then this happened. I opened my game up to 2.2 and it erased all of my data. Which I was fine with  by the way. I hadn't gone very far in it and it honestly rekindled my love for geometry dash. But I've experienced a few bugs. When I go to the vault of secrets and type in   The Challenge  to get the level so I can open the door  nothing happens. Please fix this it's a really great game.,POSITIVE,0,0.836721718,26-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,Full 5 star rating right ahead! What's amazing in geometry dash then and now is that its a canvas for anything you want to be and its really fun doing so! Even though there's a lot of bugs  you won't really care about it since most of them are used in gameplay so its still fun. Also in mobile  framerates start to go down when playing ANY level randomly. X step in 60 or any % fps goes down and you die :). Anyway  i hope its fixed as soon as the new update for mobile comes!,POSITIVE,0,0.990674794,7-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,This game is amazing  I love it! I'm a long time player (2015 on pc) and this update did not dissapoint! The only issue I have with this update is the loading saved data system  as it sometimes crashes the game when loading saved data. To fix this  I have to remove my gd account from the game and then sign in again  making me able to load it in. Apart from this  I think more coyote time should be implemented on plataformer mode  as it would make it much more enjoyable. Thank you rob for 2.2!!!!!,POSITIVE,0,0.56511575,26-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,Game is so much better than before! Although I know that 2.21 will bring much more things. I have a few problems. - Editor now makes it much harder to tell when the level starts. - Effect triggers cannot be made to edit how long the effect lasts for - Sometimes when you are creating a custom level  when you try to go back to editing  the game will kinda  crash  and wont let you back in the editor - And some of the prices for some of the new items in the shops are crazy high and hard to earn.,NEGATIVE,1,0.996764302,4-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,It's a very fun game to play. However  there is a little problem the songs are ahead of the levels rythym  causing to be quite disappointing  It's not to enjoyable if the song doesn't sync. I have tried the audio fix  but it doesn't do anything. Hope the audio gets fixed in the next update.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997015119,12-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,no game has been so effective at pissing me off than this god damn game. The lack of checkpoints (practice mode doesnt count you cant even hear the song in a rhythm game) is so brutal. I genuinely hate the fact that tapping the screen for 0.2 seconds too long makes me start the whole level over again. I enjoy rhythm games but thats because you're able to make mistakes and not have to restart instantly. I know this wont be changed but still. Also why do i lose recent orbs when exiting the game,NEGATIVE,1,0.998837769,4-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,This is probably the best mobile game on the whole store. And I have enjoyed every bit if the new 2.2 update. The platformer mode is incredible  Dash is a great level. But aside from all that. I love to create levels. And I have also been told my levels were feature worthy. So I love to make lots of neat designs and layouts I'm geometry dash. So when I was making a level  I get on my phone. And The whole editor was color inverted. And I had to completely restart my level I was so proud of.,POSITIVE,0,0.998726904,29-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,The game may be a bit challenging in the beginning  even though it may be stressful and angerish (trust me  i've gotten so mad at this game) the game is based on trial and error. The more you practice  the better you will get at the game. Anyway  the music is phenominal  and the levels are fun  and challenging in their own way. Anyways  that's what i have to say for the game  i would very much recommend you play itð.,POSITIVE,0,0.995856464,19-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,This is a game that you'll get good overtime  its really progressive.some new players actually struggle at the level start  but i think alll you need to do when you start is learn the physics and the other problem for new players is they usually click the orbs on the main level using timings instead of just buffering them  99% orbs in the main levels are bufferable  and buffer means holding before an input (b4 an orb). Overall yeah this game is really fun,POSITIVE,0,0.99720037,13-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Played 2.2 - Loved 2.2 Now that that's out of the way here are my minor complaints. Just one  really: there's a platformer bug on mobile where if you hold a movement button too early during an attempt  letting go won't have any effect and you'll continue to slide. This makes speedrunning frustrating  but more importantly  the required delay after every attempt quickly gets annoying. Still definitely 5 stars and I'm eagerly awaiting 2.21 and Explorers!,NEGATIVE,1,0.988735497,15-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Geometry dash is so fun  and 2.2 is amazing. The only problem I have is that when I try to get the challenge in the vault of secrets  the code won't go through. Also I have enough diamonds to get into the shops  but it doesn't register. It says the dialogue and just doesn't let me in. Please fix this Edit: I tried logging back in and it won't let me load my data. Now I have to start all over again,POSITIVE,0,0.7977162,25-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,The 2.2 update is great. I play on PC with no qualms. However on the mobile app  after I quit and re-enter the game.

Size: 1.17  (1.17 / 0.00)  Sometimes takes few minutes before I can save succesfully  sometimes after re-opening app it all resets to previous backup save before I'm able to save again.

Geometry Dash,I love this game the tower is nice but sometimes when you jump it doesn't jump also in the tower to and this has happened to a lot of people it can kick you off of the game and then it can restart your progress this has happened twice in the both 2 days when I got the game two days ago I would give it a five but it will happen again and again until I get very mad please fix those two bugs it gets a little annoying sometimes so I'm giving it a 4 star but it is a really good game nice songs.,POSITIVE,0,0.997724473,16-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,i love this game so much and i would've gave it a 5 stars BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE FIX THE BACKUP SAVING DATA  I've lost my account twice thanks to the new update and i cant get The challenge  and I can't access Scratch's shop and i cant access the vault of time!!!! i appreciate all the effort that goes into it but there's so many bugs introduced in this update  and it's breaking the experience and ruining the game so please it's so important to fic tyese issues as fast as possible!,NEGATIVE,1,0.998103499,31-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,Hey there  i've been playing occasionally way back 6 years ago and has been daily active since the release of 2.2 in trying to grind diamonds for the practice music option. Sadly  my whole week of hard work was lost and my 1.7k turn to 1.4k diamonds. Its not much but the stress of account not saving isnt really helping. Please fix. Big fan of the game since highschool but with this problem  i'd rather wait for the bug fix than play the game with worries everytime  Thanks for your time.,NEGATIVE,1,0.993375838,2-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,this game truly deserves a 5-star guaranteed  however the only reason i dont give it a 5 star is because of the game's saving system. This is not the only time ive lost a whole section of my time spent on this game  and i bet many would agree that the save system is forgotten. I had to transfer phones and i redownloaded the app  just for it to put me back about 500-700 stars behind  cubes and many other icons blocked  and the demons I have completed need to retain back  which is really unfair.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999705493,31-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,I love this game. You should totally get it. It is worth the two dollars that it costs. There are unlimited levels online  and more than 20 for offline. I beat my first demon not too long ago  andit makes you feel succesfull when you beat a level. DOWNLOAD IT NOW! (By the way if you see this rob plz unbug the cursed thorn bossfight. Near every time I do it it bugs out so I con't beat it:(,POSITIVE,0,0.880589902,7-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,This game is great but there are 2 issues. Whenever I want to edit my levels  the game freezes. Another one is that I got 500 diamonds. Whenever I try to get in the shop  it won't let me in. It may have something to do with the bug. I recommend some better performance but overall the game is awesome especially 2.2,POSITIVE,0,0.999485493,17-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Geometry Dash is a very addicting game that starts off simple but gets complicated  but better  as you progress through the main levels. There's many aspects of the game you can focus on such as demon grinding  star grinding or creating. The user levels are awe inspiring and some can show just how far the game mechanics can be pushed. 10/10 game.,POSITIVE,0,0.996292889,15-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,The 2.2 update is absolutely mind blowing and totally worth the wait  but I have a problem  everytime I play the platform mode when I press left it has a certain delay of about 1 second before it moves which is very annoying  strangely the right button doesn't have the same problem. I hope this will be fixed in the near future  can't complete any platform level with this bug lol,NEGATIVE,1,0.998891294,1-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Edit: All fixed in 2.2. Old Review: I feel like the lite edition is better which is weird because this one is paid. the lite version has support for screens bigger than 16:9 and its updated to the newest android versions  this is the opposite. The paid version also didnt transfer my data even though I linked my account. I'm assuming it runs off how high my frame rate is  and i have 120fps so my character goes super quick it's unplayable. and why does it need permission to view my call logs?,NEGATIVE,1,0.999507546,9-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,Great game  2.2 was definitely worth the wait. However...... I got two little issues. Firstly  the scratch shop isn't opening even though I have much more than 500 diamonds  also the last tower level  the bossfight against the cursed thorn it lags out sometimes like after it reaches a phase  sometimes it stops attacking and I have to restart it to fix....,NEGATIVE,1,0.998553813,10-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Geometry Dash delivers addictive  challenging gameplay that tests reflexes and offers a satisfying rush upon success. However  its steep difficulty curve and repetitive nature might not suit everyone's preferences. The simple design and catchy soundtrack add to the experience  but the game lacks depth for those seeking more,POSITIVE,0,0.994504988,5-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,I'm glad 2.2 is here but my main problem with it is when it keeps telling me my account backup failed and shows a file size like there is some sort of size limit. Now that just gets annoying. And to me the only way it decreases the file number in the parentheses is when I delete my levels. I can't keep deleting levels just to save my game. Why must they add a file limit?!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999678373,3-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,This is a really fun and great game! It's very challenging and easier with enough practice. The thing is  it's hard on mobile. On PC  it's much easier in my opinion  that's why I only make levels and have fun in general. Also it's poorly optimized. Still a great game  in my favorites!,NEGATIVE,1,0.947394192,15-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,Sometimes  it says I can't download a level and it will tell me to download later (Update 2.2) Hey! I have gotten much more better at the game since I wrote this first review  and the game is fun and all  but I have some complaints. Some of the custom levels are way too laggy for my phone  and some times  they don't even allow uldm  or just ldm. Another thing is during the 74% ship part in the new level Dash  it goes from a normal 60 fps to 20 fps. Pretty big difference between frames  ya think?,NEGATIVE,1,0.996412456,8-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,I've always loved geometry dash. I had the full version on my other phone but then I had to re-buy it on this phone. I love all of the main levels and custom levels. I love all the character customizations and colors (especially black). And the game play is really cool. I love you Robtop  and keep the strive going.,POSITIVE,0,0.999749959,3-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,I'm having trouble Linking my account to the other games but this is overall an awesome game  one other thing is that the checkpoints in platformer don't work  and this isn't just my device  it's also the same my brothers device  I'm not sure if that's purposeful or not but it's irritating when I get to the end of a level  die then have to go back to the very beginning.,POSITIVE,0,0.993176281,15-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,Amazing game  the base game itself is pretty mid  however the community is the one keeping the game alive. There are a lot of amazing levels  many creators are constantly breaking limits of the game. The long-waited (7 yrs) 2.2 update is already out  which added even more features for players to explore  it basically turned this game into a game engine! So yeah  if you're still wondering  you shoud definitely buy this game  before the price becomes higher.,POSITIVE,0,0.997169197,22-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,2.2 is finally here and Robtop has worked hard to get this update out for many years  as well as fixing many of the bugs previously. I've played this game for a long time  on and off  and I'm happy to see the game come so far from 10 years ago and what may come next in the future. The only bug I see so far is that the platformer checkpoints don't work  which brings me back to the start of the level.,POSITIVE,0,0.866234601,20-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,I really like the game! When it comes to rhythm games  I'm playing it. This was my childhood. However  I play on a low end device  and many 2.2 levels aren't exactly friendly to low end users. Most of the 2.2 filters cause huge lag on potato devices. Contrary to this  if you have a good device I highly recommend this game ð¥.,POSITIVE,0,0.956924736,13-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,This is the one mobile game that I consistently continue to come back to. I've been playing it on and off for maybe 5 years now  and now that 2.2 is out  I'm really grinding at it. All the new stuff added is crazy (though I'm a little miffed about spending diamonds in the diamond shop  but hey  what did I expect) and I think I'm definitely gonna be sticking around for a while this time around. Robtop consistently does an amazing job at bringing now content to us  and I can't wait for 2.21.,POSITIVE,0,0.838630259,24-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,I absolutely adore this game. I don't care it is the mobile version  it is pure joy. The levels are well designed  the icons are mostly great  there is an incredible level editor  it is just amazing! Where is 2.2 Robtop? We've been waiting years! Still a fantastic game. It is my favorite game of all time. Edit: Well nvm 2.2 IS out. NICEEEE,POSITIVE,0,0.999661803,20-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,Very fun game! Easy to learn but seemingly impossible to master  there are fun levels for any skill level. The game is original  creative  very performant  and well optimized. This game runs on just about any mobile device  even my 12 year old Samsung tablet. Geometry Dash is a must-have classic!,POSITIVE,0,0.999713361,12-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,Great platformer. Each level you can feel your reflexes and quick thinking improve. It also has lots of customization and unlockables. The only thing may need improving  is the navigation  it's a pain to get to the latest level if you already completed a lot.,NEGATIVE,1,0.956206977,15-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,I have been playing Geometry Dash for years  and like most players  beedn waiting for 2.2 to come out. When it came out  I was really excited at first  but then I realised multiple things that made me want to quit. The first thing is the new Gravity  which ruined most of the older but my favorite levels  and made them unbeatable. Also  we now are forced to make everything we build copyable  so anyone can copy and claim it as their own (even with the  Original  button) Fix this=Fix my review :),NEGATIVE,1,0.999606788,7-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,Most addictive game ever  especially with the 2.2 editor(btw thank you SO MUCH rob for releasing 2.2 near my birthday) and Dash is amazing  just like 4 major bugs. In the ship part  you can straight fly under the robot portal and barely touch the hitbox  you eventually die. Another one in the second spider part  because you forgot to add a hitbox to one of the blocks so then if you click early or late( I don't remember) you clip through but ð. Last one is you can barely goðthe portal and go â¡.,POSITIVE,0,0.984487832,18-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,really superb platformer  its worth the 2 dollars  as you get 22 main levels (not including the tower) and many online created levels. It never becomes stale  and with the demon dificulty  you can never get good enough for this game. As well  the new 2.2 update which has recently been added  creates many more paths for the online level creators to go. geometry dash's best feature  is its community.,POSITIVE,0,0.999337375,26-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,First of all  this is a very good game. I've been playing it for years. I really don't like when you guys update it because this like this may happen. The reason that I gave this review 3 stars is because of the new 2.2 update. I' ve finally got the time to create my on level. I worked on it for 5 hours yesterday. Then  I woke up today... Booted up the game and tried to edit my level  but my whole game freezed. The only option was to exit the game. So I went to play he level and use the pause...,NEGATIVE,1,0.97899729,30-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,Phenomenal game. With 2.2 out  it's basically like making your own game in the editor  and all the levels are amazing. Couple bugs here or there such as the editor getting stuck on the loading screen sometimes for unknown reasons. Platformer mode is a mario style version of the GD you know and love. The new level Dash is also amazing  as well as the new icon editor. Great work  RobTop :),POSITIVE,0,0.999660373,20-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,Nice game  can be addicting but frustrating... Also letting you unleash your creativity in the level editor as much as you want as long as you try hard and are really smart! These levels can also be uploaded as long as you want that... and if you upload those other people can play  criticize  rate and maybe even ask you to create one level together!,POSITIVE,0,0.997632146,18-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,I love this game so much  also the 2.2 update but there's only one problem I need you to fix and figure out. Everytime I try to save my account progress it keeps saying failed  Back up failed  try again later. Size: 0.53  (0.53/0.00).  My connection was so strong but why it was like this? I hope you get to fix this.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997408807,10-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,still amazing but ever since the new update a couple features don't work anymore. for example  the secret level. the challenge will no longer unlock when you type it in. also on the first boss fight in the tower mode. sometimes the boss will just not attack and I have to die in order to make him work again and restart the fight. please fix these minor bugs,NEGATIVE,1,0.993754745,2-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,It won't let me create an account because it says the email is invalid but when I go to the help menu to fix it it doesn't actually change anything. I have spent half an hour trying but its just broken. Everything else is great though and I'd say it's worth getting it if you loved the lite version.,NEGATIVE,1,0.583505034,3-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,cool game. been playing it since 2020. there are many online levels on the servers made using the level editor. even i have been using the level editor a lot and have been spending most of my time there. the level editor is pretty good  though the triggers might be confusing at times. ive also heard other people having a hard time playing the game  but keep practising so your skills get better. trust me  thats how i got to where i am currently. overall  pretty solid game. i recommend you try it.,POSITIVE,0,0.99962616,23-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Great game! The experience is great and the levels are 5 stars and the creator mode is great. I don't know if it's my phone or the game but after 2.2 came out  I managed to get 500 diamonds but can't unlock Scratch's shop  it's just the same  you've got the diamonds  text over and over.,POSITIVE,0,0.996706426,27-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,Getting to play maps made from other people and make games of your own  makes the game better then it already is. The amount of effort Robtop puts into the game for us is unspeakable  and he couldn't do anymore to satisfy me. 2.2 taking a long time to come out was worth it because of all the new achievements and the new  Dash  level.,NEGATIVE,1,0.569278836,26-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,In my opinion it's one of the best games I've played. With 2.2 being out  some of my levels I can't enter  it freezes. Please fix this Rob  anyway still 5 stars! Edit:OKAY I FOUND A FOR FOR THE LEVEL OPENIN STUFF.DONT USE A MG(MIDDLE GROUND)!!!(also stop saying you lose progress just save your data in game),POSITIVE,0,0.940994978,29-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,I loved this game...well..I did untill 2.2 came out. The update is great and I've it  but the level  dash  is kinda buggy. Once I get to one of the ship parts  the game just lags intirely and I can't beat the level. Another thing that is wrong is when I try to make a new level with the editor  once I'm out of the editor  it won't let me back in the editor. Pls fix these in 2.21 edit: my phone is a Samsung galaxy a02s,NEGATIVE,1,0.996185601,7-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,As a veteran player that haven't played Gd since 2019  the 2.2 update show me a lot of improvement towards the game. A lot of changes apparently. And the new level called  Dash  is very challenging and trippy because of the new portals and etc. And the fun thing about the game is that it hasn't been dead and the community is still active and still creating new levels in online. I don't even feel regret buying this game before in pc and mobile.,POSITIVE,0,0.997823954,22-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,It's good but dash has a part where it lags a lot and hard to play when its lagging. and the editor sometimes I build a level and won't let me back In to build my level. and won't let me back in the game and have to delete the game and lose my levels icons and coins because I didn't make an account. overall its good but has a lot of problems,NEGATIVE,1,0.982985318,31-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,It's so good it's fun extra levels fun boss is deadlocked fingerdash dash and clustep theory of everything 2!!! Have fun playing better than lite meltdown and subzero and 2.2 is here!!! Able to create levels and play other people's levels!!! All my friends play it they recommend you should play it come on play it there is more blocks swing copters and spiders and ships and balls and even UFO!!! Have more fun other colours!!! It's OP and ITS FULL VER!!! Even more fun there's more colours!!! Fun,POSITIVE,0,0.999687195,18-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,Well  you don't need me to tell you why this game is amazing. The level editor alone makes it one of the best and most versatile sandbox games ever  let alone how good the community is at using it and creating spectacular experiences. The long anticipated 2.2 update is great  however bloated and has couple issues worth addressing. I wont go into detail  but ESPECIALLY the fact that RobTop removed Force Smooth Fix sucks for mobile users. Still though  phenomenal game that has shaped my childhood.,POSITIVE,0,0.998562753,31-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,I really love this game and thanks for 2.2 But some issues I have are listed below(As a mobile player) 1.Dash has a lot of bugs of unnecessary jumping when hitting those blocks at 11% 2.I honestly like this level but the last ship part can it please have a LDM or optimization because it's too buggy and laggy to play. 3. When you tap either button in platformer mode you auto scroll in that direction.Other than that I love this game,NEGATIVE,1,0.962467492,1-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,I'm glad that 2.2 is FINALLY here. I gave this 4 stars because when i create an level in editor and i tap the create in the level it has a long loading screen and it is laggy when in the new level Dash from the part where the plane is on my phone then the last is when you create an platformer level and add the end command and when play it after you create that level it just automatically finish the level and i think its best if there's an option on creating an account on Gmail for Gmail users.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999447405,25-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,Been playing this game for 8+ years  but recently I've been experiencing save issues that will either fail to save  or will say it saved  but when i try to load my saved progress on PC  doesn't show anything that i saved from mobile (example: i have 87% on a level on mobile  but when i try to save and load it to my pc  it still just shows 85%  which was my last best that i saved),NEGATIVE,1,0.996042848,3-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,I LOVE this game especially with 2.2 I just have 1 problem So I play on Mobile and in finger dash when I get to the spider part when I click the black orb when I hit the ground there is a random chance to just make me jump again  killing me The same thing happens with dashthe new level  at the part where you have to hit the yellow blocks and avoid the red  I nail the first two but it makes me jump onto the red I don't know if this is my phone or the game but if it's the game please fix this.,POSITIVE,0,0.947285712,1-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Very fun game. I probably have over 200 - 300 hours on this game and regret none of it. It's pretty skilled based and even when I wasn't good at it I was still having the time of my life. I do see some controversy with dieing at 99% in a level but it only makes me rage if it's on a level with the difficulty of  demon . Also let me mention that I play on mobile and it makes this game much harder but to be honest I like a challenge and some of the older versions are really nostalgic so thats nice.,POSITIVE,0,0.997755587,2-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,Definitely a good game. Edit: I have noticed with the platformer mode that if you hold down a direction button  taking your finger off the direction button will not matter  and it will still make you go forward (or back) as if you didnt even remove your finger.,POSITIVE,0,0.999392152,23-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,Just bought this game month ago due 2.2 hype. But I give this 2 star (It was 3 star) because Dash are unbeatable at my phone  because around 70% of the level  the game run on lower fps  I think around that area it use lot of particles that reducing my phone performance. Luckily I found this issue while I practice  I've setting this game at lower as possible for performance  but it won't work. Hopefully next update fix this issue or adding more graphical settings.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997915685,23-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,great game  but I can't play it until it gets updated  since it keeps crashing instantly  and I've already done this once  so I deleted it and reinstalled it  and that fixed it  but now I'm not doing that  since you can't save yet  and I've made way too much progress to lose again...,NEGATIVE,1,0.995800912,30-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,The editor keeps deleting ALL of my progress  I had like two hours of work in a level and it got deleted cus I opened discord  please make an auto save every few minutes  PLEASE (new thing im mad about) in dash  the 70% ship crashes my game  and when it doesn't it makes my frames go really bad so I can NOT complete the level. Please fix soonð­,NEGATIVE,1,0.999732077,28-Apr-24

Geometry Dash,Ive been playing this for years and loved it so much  when I heard 2.2 drop I had to play it. I didn't have it because of school and me getting distracted.

Geometry Dash,I think it's funny that people in the 1* reviews all dont know that you need to make an account and manually back it up for the game to properly save your data permenantly  also robtop needs to fix one thing and that is the lag in Dash at The ship part  due to there being so many area triggers. This effects mostly bad phones (I guess that's most people on Google play) and he game is a bit long to 100%  been playing for over a year and I have gotten less than half the achievements.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999729097,22-Apr-24

Geometry Dash,In my humble opinion  I believe that there is no such game as Geometry Dash. No game has such a simple concept yet is as versatile as this masterpiece. The editor gives you limitless possibilities  expanding the game to an incredible extent. Due to the nature of the editor  the game also wouldn't die out even with the developer being lazy. To summarize  this game is incredibly unique and gives you endless options. Try it!,POSITIVE,0,0.999689579,23-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,5 Stars. This game is quite laggy  but it is AWESOME  with the new 2.2 features it feel like a different game.

Geometry Dash,An amazing game with a creative community. Very interesting Robtop-made levels to build up your skill  and tons of user-made ones to put them to the test! You can do loads of things on this game  from grinding stars and creating levels to discovering secrets! I love this game! A few suggestions I have are to clean up the settings/editor and to make the vaults have.. more interesting use (not just codes  take the spooky-glubfub interaction for example). Overall epic game  GG :D,POSITIVE,0,0.999750912,1-May-24
Geometry Dash,I like creating and playing levels  rather its playing my owns or levels by others. The platformer gamemode is cool.

Geometry Dash,2.2 Is a very good update but not being able to play gauntlets or unlock scratch slows down the progression of the storyline. I also understand that this game now has bugs due to it being so big and that's why it is 4 stars (previously 5 stars before 2.2). After these bugs are fixed it will go back to a 5 star rating. Edit: Scratch works now but the Gauntlets still don't. Rating 4.5 stars.,NEGATIVE,1,0.994430363,24-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,I have an issue and that with 2.2. With 2.2  you can be free to copy and new levels that come out. The problem is with this comes people who  will  steal your levels and will claim as their own. And I don't like it when people check the editor it just ruins it. Please add the code back!,NEGATIVE,1,0.999482095,17-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,It is one of the best games I have ever played! However  there is a lot of issue with the level editor  I can't access my level. Even if I try exiting the app  it still makes my game freeze after i clicked on the create button  please Robtop  pls fix this ;-;,NEGATIVE,1,0.994078159,10-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,very cool game with no to barely any ads at all  the levels are fun and the main line of the game teaches you the more you go on  I enjoy trial and error and hopefully you do to. But the only reason im not going to give it full stars is because of the account registration bug. If you run into the bug then please contact me,NEGATIVE,1,0.956648529,19-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Great game! I love the new update. I have one complaint though  in the new platformer game mode  sometimes  when you hold the arrow down for to long  it gets stuck. It's not to big of a problem but it is annoying. If this could be fixed in 2.21  that would be great! Keep up the good work!,POSITIVE,0,0.998246193,26-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,IT'S GOOD  THE 2.2 IS REALLY WORTH TO WAIT FOR 7 YEARS it is so much more fun. the platformer mode  the lists  that music unlocker and practice music sync (which is nice so I don't have to use mods no more). but us MOBILE PLAYERS still don't have the new updates that pc players get. which is pretty unfair at some point  'coz there's been so many Steam updates but no mobile updates  which made me disappointed. i still can't afford some of the items on the shops. PLS UPDATE GD MOBILE,NEGATIVE,1,0.606186211,16-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Amazing overall  but I have one idea. Autosave. That's all I'm gonna say for the idea  Auto. Save. Everytime I've gotten so far in creating my level  all it takes is my phone to cut off right before my eyes  and all my progress is gone. We need an autosaving system.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999364674,17-Feb-24
Geometry Dash,It's an amazing rhythmic platformer game and with it's long awaited 2.2 update the game is more alive than ever  even though this game is a 2 dollar purchase you can download the lite version or any of the spinoffs to get a nice feel for the game before purchasing  the benefits are clear when you purchase this version with no ads  more main levels plus custom levels  the level creator  and many more secrets and achievements to earn/find  highly recommend this game to any one who likes hard games,POSITIVE,0,0.999664903,2-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Great game I would extremely suggest getting the full version it is very fun thousands of mini games and you get to create as many mini games your self for free there is actually no in game purchases after you pay for the game witch is extremely cheap for how fun it is there is not anything else to pay for very good game for long drives.,NEGATIVE,1,0.96868068,14-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,The game is really enjoyable. I have a few reasons it isn't 5 stars though. Firstly the level dash at around 70% it's too laggy I play on mobile and this is so annoying. When I'm in the tower the checkpoints do not work. Please fix this bug.,NEGATIVE,1,0.989870727,13-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,This game is so fun. Even though I started playing the lite version I still enjoy it a lot. I have a few things that I don't really like. For one thing is I still don't understand how sometimes it doesn't autosave your data and thus making you manually save the data. I don't have this issue when I'm playing the game on my computer. Another issue is that I hate how sometimes I can't download a custom song even though I have wifi or cell service. I think this is just an issue on my end of the game,NEGATIVE,1,0.991240561,24-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,Nooooooooo! I lost my good progress considering that I'm still a beginner. Just started playing 3 days and made good progress like completing 5 demon levels got 37 secret coins completed stereo madness  back on track  polargeist dry out till clutterfunk and lost my progress. You can look at my  account  it's name is SXCH010 please help!,NEGATIVE,1,0.998886883,9-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,Awesome game  been playing it for years  but 2.2 seems like wishful thinking now. For any newer players  we've been waiting for 2.2 for a very  very  VERY long time  I was in school and graduated and it's STILL not out  literal years have passed and no update  don't mean to crush your hopes and dreams  but 2.2 will probably never happen EDIT: ..I take back what I said about 2.2,NEGATIVE,1,0.991067588,3-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,The game is fun and has amazing levels that come with good rewards  but the level windy landscape is kinda bugged at 2-3 percent of the level. Overall the game is awesome with good icons  main levels  and online levels.,POSITIVE,0,0.996381402,12-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,A fun game to play to pass time. There are over 5 nice mechanics that make this game unique. Allows you to create levels and put your own creative spin on it. Hundreds of levels are being uploaded by people every minute. Having your volume up is a must  so i don't recommend you play this in quiet public areas. Also  MAJOR epilepsy warning. As a non-epileptic person  the amounts of flasing lights slightly hurt my eyes. Definitely should lower your brightness before playing.,POSITIVE,0,0.992646933,5-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,Never ending problems with saving progress. If you look at the game wrong  everything disappears. My son has spent countless hours playing and making/editing levels. Despite following every step to save progress  it is constantly losing all data. He deeply loves this game and it breaks his heart  again and again.,POSITIVE,0,0.790162623,13-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,It's a great game. 2.2 is a game-changer for GD and made everything very cool. But there is one thing I request  RobTop can you please make triggers work when you playtest the song on the level editor? It could map out an exact plan to sync the song.,POSITIVE,0,0.59701246,5-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,I really enjoy this game it's one of my favorites it's a very fun/Challenging/rage and a bit of strategie I've gotten far it takes a bit of practicing but you'll get the hang of it. Highly recommend and just one thing to the makers in the make a level can y'all add a search bar above copy and paste.,POSITIVE,0,0.999122918,10-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,Really fun  but some levels like stereo madness and jumper are too long and hard. Also I tried to use the level editor and it was so confusing. Why does this game not have any save states or anything? I played for a while and almost beat the first level when my game closed because my phone could not run the last part. I tried playing some levels random people made  but they all had weird green heads and no sound  like how do you make it play music? Only lvl I beat was minusdry in 1674837 attempt,NEGATIVE,1,0.999423623,14-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,It's pretty good but kinda hard. I'd say it's a game for mobile hard-core gamers. You can play levels made by other people and they usually have original songs or remixes of other songs. All in all  pretty good! Edit: This is like years in the future this is the best game ever made. Get it.,POSITIVE,0,0.999774873,7-Apr-24
Geometry Dash,Overall its an amazing game and 2.2 was very creative but there were 2 problems that I found 1. The ship part nere the end of the 2.2 level dash it became extremely laggy so it was inpossable to play 2. I can't access the shop once I got to scratch he just would not let me in after he said that I can hopefully these get fixed soon,NEGATIVE,1,0.99887532,10-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,This game is really fun I didn't know there was new lvls because I play geometry dash lite so I didn't expect new lvls but anyways awesome game dude keep up the work and I love how there is a shop I didn't expect that either so I was surprised and glow? I just can't say anything about this I am so curious about glow.and tower?? I love it I love lvls getting harder and harder it gives us a challenge for real my fav is  Blast Prosses  I think that's what it's called but nice game ð¤«ð§,POSITIVE,0,0.99936372,1-May-24
Geometry Dash,I love this game and the new update is so insane but theres a one thing disappointing me  the ship is so hard to control because its like its so light that it can fly with less tap/press but its also like heavy that the ship shrink/ fly down easily. This made harder+ levels with ship more difficult to play . But i still love the game  its so good with the new update,POSITIVE,0,0.714662254,27-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,A truly legendary game. 2.2 has a lot to offer and there's even more than before. Some of the things that worked before  (such as typing in  TheChallenge   loading gameplay to other Geometry Dash games  and opening up Scratch's shop)  are not functioning properly. But besides that  I love it.,POSITIVE,0,0.996919155,28-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,For $2  this game is an absolute steal no matter how you look at it. So much work and love has been put into the development and updating the game that honestly this price point is absurdly cheap for the work that has gone into it. Yes there are bugs and glitches (that don't really affect standard gameplay) with the new update  but for a $2 game it offers nearly unlimited content. Don't keep scrolling down the reviews  just buy the game if you are interested.,NEGATIVE,1,0.966622233,12-Jan-24
Geometry Dash,Cool game  but zero native controller support  which is extremely surprising to me as it feels like this is exactly the sort of game that benefits from as little input lag as possible. I tried using screen mapping  but the input delay is unbearable. - retroid pocket 4 pro,POSITIVE,0,0.95279181,1-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,Sure people are mad about the 2.2 update  but why? Just because the tower boss fight is hard and your just bad? Or maybe its because of the bugs of the 2.2 build (even when we've been hounding for it and even when there is a confirmed 2.21 update soon) and your mad your phone keeps crashing and the game is so horribly optimized? Sucks for you  cause for me  on my S7  this game runs perfectly fine. The new 2.2 update added a TON of awesome mechanics that has changed level making forever  so cope.,POSITIVE,0,0.971723795,25-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,Geometry Dash is a riveting and visually stunning game that seamlessly combines challenging gameplay with an immersive audio-visual experience. From its sleek design to its heart-pounding soundtrack  this game earns a well-deserved five-star rating. The first aspect that captivates players is the game's minimalist yet striking geometric design. The clean lines and vibrant colors create an aesthetically pleasing environment  enhancing the overall gameplay,POSITIVE,0,0.999870658,23-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,THIS IS A HELL YEA 2.11 WAS GREAT  AND 2.2 JUST MADE 2.11 LOOK LIKE AN UNFINISHED PRODUCT  But theres a couple bugs I'm expirenceing  like where I cant save my data and when I do and try to load it the game crashes. And when I try loading it in other games (Such as world) It keeps saying backup failed. Please fix this bug and I'll edit the review,NEGATIVE,1,0.999457061,22-Dec-23
Geometry Dash,2.2 just came out and I am a mobile player and on the editor sometimes when you try to load the editor on a level sometimes it just doesn't load and you can never load that level again so if you're on mobile and editing a level  you just pray that you get lucky and you don't lose the level forever. Okay now its 5 stars because it got fixed!!,NEGATIVE,1,0.686220288,24-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,I recommend instead of wasting your money on the mobile version get steam on your computer. Geometry Dash itself is good and you can get good at it really fast  it's easy to learn and play with a bunch of levels  and there's player-made levels too.,POSITIVE,0,0.999651909,27-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,Well worth the couple of bucks. With the 2.2 update  there's almost limitless content including rhythm platforming and new traditional platforming. There's also an incredibly detailed/expansive level creator with some of the best creation tools I've seen built into a game. 10/10 would eat here again.,POSITIVE,0,0.999490261,18-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,Its good but the dash level is very laggy its good lots of levels you can even make your own level ye so its very fun but the dash level i recommend this game to all of you its very fun so many levels example:pixi change of scene ispywithmylittleeye bloodbath and lots of other levels collect skins ships spaceships robots spiders swingcopters waves trails and a few more thing,POSITIVE,0,0.995690167,19-Mar-24
Geometry Dash,If I could rate with a half-star  then I could rate this four and a half stars. The gameplay and glitches are terrible  but otherwise fun.

Geometry Dash,This game is incredible  with challenging levels that make you get hooked on  it's possible that I've put hundreds of hours into this game. With a large community constantly making levels  it literally has endless replayability  as well as an editor mode to make your own levels. I honestly recommend  5/5,POSITIVE,0,0.998515546,7-Jan-24
Stardew Valley,I have 2 requests.. can they add more  padding  settings? Like for the top of the screen  bottom of the screen  and map? I use a phone and pressing the very edges just to move to another part of the map is incredibly annoying. . Also  please make it so we can move the pets(maybe with the watering can for the cat and food for the dog). I keep having the problem of them being in the way. Like one time my cat wouldn't move away from my bed so I couldn't sleep. Also.. can the toolbar settings save?,NEGATIVE,1,0.999366462,30-Apr-24
Stardew Valley,The game is good  but I have two problems. 1: ground textures near bodies of water like lakes  rivers  and ponds are bugged and sort of jump up with black lines. 2: the controls for the slingshot with the joystick and buttons setting is broken and barely usable  as though the controls were only a quarter way implemented and then promptly forgotten about.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999744594,26-Apr-24
Stardew Valley,Game itself is amazing  no questions there  saw one review where someone said it's ridiculous that your character gets tired  well if you play for more than 10 minutes it gets easier as you go. I also don't understand those who say mobile is difficult. I have this game on PC  Switch  and my phone and most of my play time has been on my phone. No  I don't use a controller or a tablet  just the touch screen. If you're struggling with it  there are options so play around with those until it works,NEGATIVE,1,0.989398599,27-Apr-24
Stardew Valley,I love this game so far  the only issue I have with the mobile version is that i always have a hard time to place buildings  move around furnitures and create clothes. It doesn't respond  and it just glitches.. I hope you can fix this ð­ I want to make new clothes and rearrange my coops and barns!!!! Also  it's so hard to play on mobile with no controllers. If you buy this app  make sure you're playing with a controller.,NEGATIVE,1,0.993506789,23-Apr-24
Stardew Valley,Best game ever ported from PC. however I would suggest to add 8 directional on screen dpad controls. And some adjustments to the control schemes  like reworking onscreen controls for compatibility of sling shot use. its really hard to use the slingshot. Also i would like to report some bugs that occur quite often in the mines(possibly in skull cavern aswell  have not tested it) when standing in certain x or y tiles the character is forced to attack facing either down  left  up or right.,NEGATIVE,1,0.895985901,26-Apr-24
Stardew Valley,Good port of one of the greatest games ever  but I have one small issue. Whenever I play games on my phone  it's usually when I'm not home  and I have a few minutes to kill. However  in order to save my progress  I have to go through a whole day or sleep early and waste in game time that I could've spent doing something. I think if there were a soft save option  where if you close the game mid-day  that it would save your progress from that day  so you can finish any tasks for the day later.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99947387,22-Apr-24
Stardew Valley,I have this game on xbox and android phone. Absolutely love the game and would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the bed moving feature and placing building on mobile being so difficult. When trying to go to sleep sometimes i accidently pick up the bed and when i want to pick up the bed on purpose to rearrange the room i can't. I click and hold on it goes to bed and using the axe doesn't work either. For buildings i have to zoom in and out to move it. It just too hard and frustrating.,NEGATIVE,1,0.997139692,20-Apr-24
Stardew Valley,Great game  I just have this bug (on mobile) where the screen suddenly turns black except for the energy bar and the highest/top spot of the inventory. Just sharing my experienceâThis game saved me from a burn-out. Encouraged me to do my homework  advance study  overall put more effort into my life because of how the game seems to encourage me to put effort into the game itself. I'm young but this showed me what I should be prepared for in life  how I should work  &never take things for granted.,NEGATIVE,1,0.992585599,14-Apr-24
Stardew Valley,Absolutely amazing game. But there are a few bugs. Controls sometimes mess up  and theres a bug where when you open the bulletin board in the community center and then exit  I've gotten stuck and not been able to move at all except to change items  the time is also frozen when this happens and so you can't just wait till 2am. I've had to completely close the game and restart the same day three times. Update 2/8/24: I would REALLY like this bug fixed,NEGATIVE,1,0.997633934,8-Feb-24
Stardew Valley,Great game  good port. I'm using a Backbone controller and the gameplay feels like playing a Switch  where I'm using both touchscreen and the controller. I wish there were more options to change the controller and touch settings  but overall the port is good. The game is Great. If you haven't played it  I highly recommend giving it a try. If you're not big on farming  it doesn't have to be a primary role. I recommend fishing and mining first if that's the case.,POSITIVE,0,0.999770105,25-Mar-24
Stardew Valley,A really great port of the game on the phone! If you aren't familiar with SDV  it is a fun farming game with a lot of stuff to feature as you progress the game. Gameplay will vary per person and it is also open-ended so there is a lot of flexibility depending on you play. Having fun is important. However  the recent updates have made some controls and graphics look and feel weird. Small errors that won't softlock you at all  so still give this game a go!,POSITIVE,0,0.996973634,9-Feb-24
Stardew Valley,great gameplay  I'm only halfway through the first year but I'm honestly addicted. would have gotten 5 stars if it weren't for the bugs. The main problem is when trying to interact with certain shops  I have to close n reopen the game (after saving). A bigger problem is occasionally the world will go black (except the inventory bar) and I have to close out and start my day over  but that has only happened twice to me. However  the extremely fun gameplay makes it 4/5 stars even with these bugs.,POSITIVE,0,0.892039835,5-Mar-24
Stardew Valley,Great game  as always  but huge game breaking bug  not the good kind. Everytime I try to back out of any of the menus  on controller  it keeps crashing the game  forcing me to restart the day. Really wish this wasn't a thing  I keep forgetting about it  and I keep having to restart days. It's happened several times during the same day. Super frustrating.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999363959,11-Mar-24
Stardew Valley,Great game  Mobile Controls suck though. There's a Good Hundred Hours that you can pour into this game  but the controls (Even With a Controller) suck for combat. The enemies get too close and attack before you swing  If you fight duggies or crabs you'll be stuck in the same spot  Slashing your sword like crazy. If you change the controls to make it a little more bearable (With Sticks on Screen) then your fingers will most likely be in the way of important things or enemies.

Stardew Valley,"Don't get me wrong - I love this game on PC and this is almost a direct port. But therein lies the problem - nothing is made to accommodate mobile's lack of good control schemes. The auto-combat is the worst aspect of this version, causing me to constantly get hit when I wouldn't in the PC version. I get beat up by slimes because the character doesn't slash at the right time.

Stardew Valley,Quite brilliant though still not as good as windows version. A few things where it's better are fishing is easier on mobile and the bundles are slightly better. The downside is auto battle mode made it difficult to switch tools and there's this green line when you fish at the river and lakes. Also there's a bug where game gets stuck when you enter the bulletin board bundles.

I can't wait to see any new updates on this. If you're considering buying it because you like the computer version then i highly recommend it.

And remember, you got 8 different way to control your farmer. So pick one you think you comfortable with and learn it. Just a few adjustment, i like to see zoom option in game option, not like having  pinch to zoom  and get reverted when the option turned off.

Stardew Valley,"Exactly what it says on the tin: hit game Stardew Valley for mobile. You can zoom in and out by pinching which makes the game WAY easier in a lot of ways, but be careful of what you're holding when tapping and be sure to organize your inventory - you have access to all of it at once but you have to scroll through it.

Stardew Valley,"I was hesitant to buy this game because of all the reviews that complained about the function and efficiency of the touch/tap to move instead of the universal D-pad but HONESTLY, it is not that bad. Your finger is the mouse, so using a stylus makes it quite a bit easier so you can see everything you're doing. Also, instead of tapping on objects or ground spots to move, you can just tap and drag your finger whichever way you want to go. I also haven't ran into any glitches or bugs at all.",POSITIVE,0,0.952459693,13-May-19

Yes the controls are different, but there's a button in the top left to instantly switch from tap-screen movement to joypad control which is great for going from planting to moving around! Some precision is lost compared to PC but it's the best it can be for what it is, and only takes an hours practice max. A great port and the best value game on the store.

My issue is that fishing, the most convoluted part of the PC game, is even more convoluted on mobile. I don't know if it has to do with my phone's touch screen, but there is just enough lag after tapping that I have to be able to fully predict the fish's movements to stand any chance, and the bar degades so rapidly that there's 0 room for error or chance to save it.",NEGATIVE,1,0.998106241,18-Mar-19

There's a lot of depth to the gameplay and progression that isn't found in other mobile games. Perfect for long or short sessions too, especially since the game is split into days.

The real cons to this game: The pet you get is absolutely useless. I've heard it's worse if you get a cat because they'll be in your way, with no way around. At least the chickens move. You can't sell certain gifts/rewards, so the only option is to find a use for it, or trash it. Super fun otherwise!",NEGATIVE,1,0.999198854,29-Apr-19

The way progression is paced by the player makes me feel like nothing I do is a waste of time. The only drawback is the combat controls for mobile in the mines. It's hard to move and attack at the same time, so I often swing wildly until a monster runs into my weapon. This wouldn't be a big deal, but mine minerals are required for a lot of crafting.

On max volume I can barely hear the sound effects and the music sounds like it's being played underwater. The resume playing function is also a bit janky as sometimes it just doesn't save my progress.

Stardew Valley,"First off, I love this game on mobile. But I found a bug in one of the control buttons: Invisible Joystick & 2 buttons using the horizontal toolbar. Tried to select on the tools on most of the bar and doesn't let me select it. It doesn't have any issues on other control options but I hope you can fix this one in the next patch. Thanks.",NEGATIVE,1,0.98902446,3-Mar-20
Stardew Valley,"Some reviews here don't realize there's A LOT of controller options to choose & customize to your liking in the Settings menu. I intended to play with an ext. controller but ended up using touch because it was way faster. I only hope they add a confirmation screen soon when switching to a previous save. Get this game, it's definitely an amazing port of SDV to mobile. The devs are quick to patch issues the past few days, and I'm sure they're working around the clock to fix more and update.",POSITIVE,0,0.995510101,20-Mar-19
Stardew Valley,"I love this game, the enviornment is so peaceful, the characters are interesting and make me actually want to get to know them better! The graphics are cute and fun, the mines are fun to explore with each level, it's all wonderful! Though, sometimes the game slows down if you zoom out too far, and on very rare occastions can crash, but again, that's rare. The option of marrying anyone regardless of gender is a huge breath of fresh air to me, and I welcome it! Very fun game, would reccomend!",POSITIVE,0,0.999876142,18-Feb-20
Stardew Valley,"Has SMAPI support! Which means MODS sort of. There are only a few mods that have been updated to work on Android, and it does require some fiddling to get everything running correctly but my must have mods (tractor mod, automate, and cheat menu) all work perfectly. Controls work pretty well, some of the best I've seen for touch screen, menus have all been updated for touch screen. Everything else is right from the PC version. I think it's version 1.2 or 1.3 so a little behind on updates.",POSITIVE,0,0.998005569,26-Jan-20
Stardew Valley,"Honestly? It's really good, there's only one bug that i encounter, and it's when i open up the app for the first time, the opening cutscene glitched. After that, i closed the app and reboot it again. The 2nd time, the glitch didn't appear and i have never encounter any other bugs after that. This is a really nice port since i have played the game on PC before. The auto-attack and auto-switch tools feature makes it even easier to mine and collect resources than in the pc version. I love it",POSITIVE,0,0.998840034,9-Jan-21
Stardew Valley,"One of my favourite games :) Just gonna respond to some of the reviews: 1/ you can save the game in settings. There's a 'save backup' button. When you exit the game and restart, you also get a pop-up message asking if you want to pick up from where you left off, even if you hadnt saved. 2/ to water multiple tiles, click and hold on a tilled tile. This only works if your watering can is upgraded to at least the copper version.",NEGATIVE,1,0.993543267,2-Feb-22
Stardew Valley,"Overall the game is really good and well thought out and I love the characters and their developments, I've played off mobile, but if I were to complain about something ON mobile it would be the story plots. I cant live them, sometimes when I get to interact with characters it freezes and I can't watch the plot go on and thats something I'd like to experience, but overall, the game is great. I would love to see more games like this in the future.",POSITIVE,0,0.999814093,24-Oct-21
Stardew Valley,"Usually, if there are mobile games that have been ported from PC or console, they're either watered down, only tangentially similar, or a cash grab lootbox-filled mess. Not so here! This is a faithful recreation of the  full-size  experience, right down to the control options. The only thing lacking is multiplayer, but that's a non-factor for me anyway.

Stardew Valley,"Seems almost perfect conversion of the PC game. Absolutely brilliant. The only gripe I have, and not sure if it's just me missing something, but I can't seem to find item descriptions in my inventory and I have to go though the list of traded items to find a description.

I'm struggling a lot with anxieties, this year more than ever, playing this game whilst listening to music, an audio book or a podcast is very relaxing.

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,"I've updated my ratings from 1 to 5 stars now. The game has had a lot of bug fixes. Even graphics have been tidy up, and it's so much more smooth to run. Plus, as a bonus, you can still change graphics elements individually, unlike the definitive version. It doesn't make my device heat up and framerate plus frame pacing is spot on. I think its the closet SA war drum messed up version, video games deluxe can bring to Rockstar original game on the PS2. I think its worth it to purchase it now.",NEGATIVE,1,0.775736749,25-Apr-24
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,"Now controller support is ok, but it feels like it's not optimized. My phone is very hot, and this never happened on the previous versions of the game, even with graphics options on max. Also, the screen aim is no longer working when using a controller. The only way to perform a headshot using it, was touching the head of the enemy on the screen and then shooting on the controller, but this is not working anymore, because the aim doesn't lock, so it's impossible to perform a headshot now. :(",NEGATIVE,1,0.99954468,19-Apr-24

Better to the point that it now seems like it's in 60fps instead of 30fps. Awesome.

Like jumping by simply point up instead of having a separate button for jump and a separate button for aim and Fire AND both are on the same thumb so you basically have to let go of the attack button when you need to jump.

The thing that kills you the most is trying to mine or place torches when an enemy comes by. It's clumsy to look at the icons to swap to your weapon while running to avoid dmg. You frequently get swarmed, accidentally select something that isn't your weapon, or run off a cliff. It slows the gameplay.

This is just from what I was able to figure out, so the experience might not be as close to the original as possible. In order to get what is as close as you can to the original mobile controls, you want to enable autoswing, left stick aim, magnifier, pick up text, and set the jump controls to swipe up(legacy).

Terraria,The game has a lot of potential however I would recommend to avoid playing on small devices as it is easy to miss press a button and end up 6 feet underground. A good way to counter this problem is to allow for the controls to be customisable (eg.

Another problem I have with the game is the Pay To Win items, but it doesn't bother me all too much considering it's a single player game, but I'd rather it not be here in the first place.

While I don't really need the survival kit since I understand how to play, it's a good option for anyone struggling or if you just want the cheats for fun. The only issue I had with this port is sometimes one of the side buttons won't work until I open up the monitor which killed me twice in 4/20. but a small problem that can be easily fixed.

Five Nights at Freddy's,this is a game I have been playing for a long time and loved and I came back to it to have some childhood nostalgia.

Love the Freddy blackout jumpscare,POSITIVE,0,0.949746907,16-Jul-20
Five Nights at Freddy's,"The game is great, especially with the new update. The new update took some getting used to but I definitely enjoyed playing this game. It takes a lot of skill and strategizing to finish the entire game and get 3 stars, but with enough practice and hard work, it's beatable. Not really any huge reward/payout besides bragging rights and getting fired, but I'd say it's still worth it. Anyways, I 100% recommend",POSITIVE,0,0.99978143,6-Sep-19
Five Nights at Freddy's,I've been a huge fan of FNAF for a while and always wanted to play one of the games but I'm terrible at it but it's also super fun even if I'm bad at it I get excited when I can play the game the horror of it not that bad it makes you jump almost every single time it's the best no bugs that I've seen it worked just fine would recommend it if you can handle a little horror,POSITIVE,0,0.999675632,28-Nov-22
Mini Metro,"Great little game! Fun to figure out and very challenging, without being too much for ppl who aren't big gamers. I like that it has online daily challenges, as well as different play modes (sandbox = yes!), to keep things fresh. I also like that the city maps are all REAL places and that various elements in the game are tailored to each. The list of (mostly locked at start) maps IS long (34 total), but am hoping more are added eventually; many are quite easy to unlock w/ basic game achievements.",POSITIVE,0,0.999648452,4-Apr-24

Cyan/green are too close in hue, and the navy is rough in dark-mode. 2. I'd love to see data mid-game for where all my locomotives and carriages are. The trains get visually obscured by the stop. Too often, I have more or fewer trains on the line than I think. A quick count of trains per line would better help my judgement.",NEGATIVE,1,0.997954488,19-Feb-24

New station in the middle of existing lines? It's not connected even though it appears that way. Want to connect the end of line to another spot? Here's a whole different line...",NEGATIVE,1,0.997365177,10-Nov-23

Mini Metro,The deceptively simple job of organizing a metro network does not sound very fun. However this game takes the annoying and repetitive idea and spins it around to force you to strategies and make difficult decisions about how to better connect stations all while keeping you on your toes. But it does give you room to breath with the pause button and the simple rules of the game.,POSITIVE,0,0.794252694,8-Nov-23
Mini Metro,"Pretty balanced game. Sometimes relaxing, sometimes challenging. Always entertaining. I think it is better to add removal of lines or rerouting of lines.

Multiple times I have lost because I am struggling to rearrange lines, trying multiple ways for several minutes and it is doing everything but what I am trying to get it to do, screwing the lines up further and with no way to undo it. I'm doing what the guide says and it isn't working.",NEGATIVE,1,0.997686863,6-Nov-23
Mini Metro,"Absolutely fantastic as far as mobile games goes, it really utilizes the medium in a natural way. Of course there is some clunkiness when it comes to selecting the right things or seeing what you're doing, but that's inherent to using a touchscreen with fat fingers. -1 star because i think the tutorial was lacking. Either I missed it or it didn't explain how to redraw lines, especially removing a node in the middle of a line took me a while to figure out. Highly recommend otherwise.",POSITIVE,0,0.84518975,20-Jun-23
Mini Metro,"A very fun and challenging logic/puzzle/strategy game. The different locations makes for a bit of variety and even though the core game loop is repetitive, it's not boring as you are constantly getting better at the game and trying new approaches. The goal is just to get your best score, so you can't really  win , which may be off-putting to some. Runs perfectly on my phone and not hard to see what's going on, but is a little bit small/fiddly and may be better on a larger screen like a tablet.",POSITIVE,0,0.993032336,2-Jul-23
Mini Metro,"The game itself is great, but I do find the menu system, specifically ability to move between Normal and Extreme mode, very frustrating. You have sacrificed usability for an overly-simple menu system. To figure out how to unlock a specific level in Extreme mode, I have to go to that mode only to have to switch back to Normal mode and hope to remember the specifics -  was it only two trains, or only two tunnels? . Fix that UX/UI issue, and you've got a 5-star game.",NEGATIVE,1,0.855128169,26-Oct-23
Mini Metro,"I'm more of a transport nerd than a gamer, so this is the first game I've played in years. I really love the concept, but I'd play it more if it was more realistic (you can't move rail corridors in real life, but you can control where stations are built), and I wish it left time to strategise, and made summary statistics available, instead of it being a race against the clock and having to eyeball it.",POSITIVE,0,0.982295513,7-Jul-23
Mini Metro,"A very fun game that involves thinking how to manage lines well. The tutorial is very simple, straightforward, and clear. I'm not sure if it's just me or the game does not allow you to zoom in the map which kinda makes arranging lines a bit difficult the more you play. The screenshot and GIF recording feature could use some 'Save to Phone' button rather than a share button alone. Those aside, the puzzles are great even if the week prizes are unforgiving at times, it just adds more fun. 5/5!",POSITIVE,0,0.999534011,9-Aug-23
Mini Metro,"I struggle to imagine a more perfectly designed game. The controls are intuitive and expertly calibrated. The graphics, reminiscent of a well-drawn train map, are beautiful. As you play a level, notice the extremely subtle  zoom out  that allows for more space in which to play. The simple premise allows for tiny tweaks that add interesting constraints and challenges. The seamless transition from normal mode to endless or creative mode after losing feels like a reward. This game is wonderful.",POSITIVE,0,0.999855399,19-Jul-20
Mini Metro,"Really great, beautifully designed and both meditative and addictive! My only grudge is, I'd love to have an  undo  button: it could be active only for x seconds, but quite often I happen to misconnect the metro line instead of moving a car.. and sometimes I don't see or remember exactly what I did.. That said, I'm playing on a phone, not a tablet. And it took me some time to find out how to actually really unconnect points.. again, maybe tiny-screen-related. Great game, though!!",POSITIVE,0,0.991653919,24-Mar-20
Mini Metro,"This game is amazing. Simple concept, easy graphics, and yet it has complicated enough strategy to be really challenging right off the bat! I'd love to see some improvements like indicating which cities you've already passed the challenges on without needing to open the separate page per city, or being able to turn challenges on and off and on again within the same level (London and Berlin are KILLING me) but that's minor aesthetics around a really well designed game.",POSITIVE,0,0.998807549,29-Jun-23
Mini Metro,"THE BEST MOBILE GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED! Seriously, this is an amazing puzzle game with simple mechanics, great minimalistic artstyle, lots of challenges and replayability.

Mini Metro,"Enjoyed this game a few years ago, enjoying it again now. Nice to see the new features and cities. The only issue for me is in Extreme mode, it's too easy to start a new line instead of a new segment accidentally, which easily can ruin the game - should be an option to cancel that, probably. Adding a few more achievements for each city would be nice too.",NEGATIVE,1,0.976311862,15-Jun-23
Mini Metro,"Beautiful puzzle game, clean interface. Simple, then rapidly gets out of control until your metro overloads--inevitably, since you are not given enough resources to handle the growing population. Not exactly the Zen experience its design implies, but addictive. Touch UI takes a minute to get used to since there are so many adjustments you can make--you can even micro-adjust two identical routes to align them just like a Tube map, not affecting gameplay, but aesthetically satisfying.",POSITIVE,0,0.865306914,13-Mar-20
Mini Metro,"This game is extremely streamlined and fun to play, presenting an interesting challenge basing each map on a real-world metro system. My only issue with this game is that I feel an opportunity was lost in not offering fun alternative modes, challenges and out of the box ideas. I would have loved to see some imaginary future city's and Ancient kingdoms, potentially with different modes of travel, i.e. teleporters, trains with different speeds, Horse and buggy.",POSITIVE,0,0.821302354,19-Apr-23
Mini Metro,"Best $0.99 app I've yet to purchase- in fact I've been quite glued to the somewhat addictive game for several days now! I enjoy the clean &  simple  design aspect, and especially love the audio layering and unique/spontaneous music generation aspect as each train has its own key, scale, and notes that create a lovely atmosphere. Edited to add: as mentioned in the description of the app unfortunately my new Bluetooth headphones do not work with the audio, but using my aux cord solves that issue.",POSITIVE,0,0.999598682,30-Jan-23
Mini Metro,"One of my favorite games if all time. Definitely less than a realistic take on urban rapid transit, but it gets the spirit 100% right.

Mini Metro,"Game is very fun and addicting, but buggy. I play it on my computer so I figured I would get the app version for killing time when my laptop is not around. Zoom and screen scrolling are glitchy and jumpy. I thought  oh well, it's just not optimized for phones.  Then I noticed pinch zooming and screen gestures were this way with all my apps (especially Google maps) so I thought something was wrong with my phone. Eventually I uninstalled this app and phone is working normal again. Samsung S20+",NEGATIVE,1,0.994899452,4-Apr-21

Would be great if the scores for the Daily mode lasted longer than a week. Currently, the scores reset and are removed every Monday, which means you don't get to see how well you did on Sunday.",NEGATIVE,1,0.980730176,7-Nov-22
Mini Metro,"Fun and challenging! I've really enjoyed the simplicity, design, and challenge this game has. It was worth the one dollar in price, no ads (obviously), and so many levels! I wish there were more tips and tricks, or more customization for easier levels (it'd be really fun to build a complex track, for only a handful of station types, more complexity, without as much difficulty) but that's probably just because I'm not very good at this game.",POSITIVE,0,0.997582197,26-Nov-22
Mini Metro,"Great minimalist type game, simple enough to understand right off the bat. I appreciate the fact that there's no messing around with any lengthy unnecessary tutorials (the mechanics are simple enough to not warrant one, It's seriously not that difficult) the controls are a bit finicky, I find it hard to remove a track from a station, and everytime I do manage to do it I have no idea how I did it, but apart from that definitely worth the 99 cents.",POSITIVE,0,0.792764544,28-Nov-20
Mini Metro,This is a cool game. The simple idea is to connect up stations in a rail network and transport the passengers. Simple enough right? But the stations become more and more crowded and you get more and more different shapes that need to be transported around your network. And most levels have some kind of water to bridge or tunnel which you often have limited supply. It's a real challenging puzzle game which keeps drawing you in to play more. I really like this game so I can recommend it 100%,POSITIVE,0,0.999602139,16-Nov-19
Mini Metro,"Interesting concept, but there aren't clear goals, beyond just  continue to survive , and as a result there's no satisfaction of having achieved them or finishing a level. Less of a puzzle, more of a stress test. Also, the controls are difficult: sometimes when I'm trying to drag a line, a vehicle that was hidden behind a station moves instead and I can't easily move it back to its original line.

Mini Metro,"Fascinating gameplay in an amazing package, perfect for those who have ever dreamt of designing their own subway map, or, alternatively for others, just a fun, ad-free and therapeutic strategic game.

There are various ways to play to achieve a more relaxed state without the visual noise or extreme sounds.

Mini Metro,"The game is fabulous and I also enjoy it on my PC. The one downside of the mobile version is that it feels harder to select the correct line to edit at a busy node, and it's easy to accidentally move a train when trying to edit connections.

Mini Metro,"As someone who loves maps and urban planning type subjects, this game is right up my alley. It is so much fun, and a great way to pass time while sequestered away at home alone. It's thoughtfully designed gameplay with a deceptively simple look that rapidly spirals out of control as your cities grow. The responsive soundtrack is a nice bonus, too. I'm not kidding when I say the first time I tried this, I wound up playing it for four hours straight! I love the challenges on each level, especially since they are a) optional and b) easily set aside once you lose, so you can keep playing endlessly even when things inevitably go wrong.",POSITIVE,0,0.998672724,22-Mar-20
Mini Metro,"Love it! However I usually loose because I don't notice stations that are not connected (new ones, or by accident disconnected). I think its a must to notify players that a station is not connected with a visual effect (e.g. glowing in a radius around it like an alarm) thus the user to be aware of it. Please add this feature to enhance user experience. Thanks!",POSITIVE,0,0.997620523,16-Nov-19
Mini Metro,"A great strategy time sink! I like that, unless you're playing in Endless mode, games can be completed in about 20 minutes. Great, simple, minimalistic interface. A couple of suggestions/requests: it would be nice to be able to save a game to come back to later. Also, sometimes there are parameters or restrictions on a particular city that you're not aware of unless you try to do something that goes against those restrictions. For instance, in one city I tried to add a fifth locomotive to a line but a message popped up saying that city cannot have more than four per line . There was no way (that I'm aware of) to have known that. It'd be nice, while you're playing a city, for there to be a button you can tap on to review the unique rules for that city. I've completed the basic goal for each city (there's about 10 or 12 cities) and that's the only negative thing that I can come up with. Great game!",NEGATIVE,1,0.991696954,26-Sep-18
Mini Metro,"While this game has been very well made, and is an excellent idea, sadly it has no level save function. So while it saves your progress when you complete a level, you cannot start a level, leave half way through and come back to it. You lose any progress on levels you're still playing when you exit the game. This would have been a great 10 minute time filler for commuter journeys on the way to work. Sadly because of the lack of save functionality I doubt I'll play this very often.",NEGATIVE,1,0.99953258,20-Jul-19
Mini Metro,"Great fun, but it becomes incredibly difficult almost immediately. This wouldn't be a problem, as the mechanics are easy to understand, but fidgeting with multiple lines is frustrating, especially if they share similar paths. When editing a line it becomes difficult to select the correct one, or at times it will connect to the wrong station when two or more are too close together. This makes long sessions annoying, because the player will be constantly fighting the controls, instead of playing.",NEGATIVE,1,0.998701334,29-Mar-20
Mini Metro,"This is one of my favourite mobile games. (It's available on PC also I think) It's simple and easy to play, but it still brings you a challenge when more stations appear. There are a lot of different levels or cities, and if you are not up for the challenge the game offers, there is a creative mode where everything is unlimited and you're free to do what you want.",POSITIVE,0,0.999137998,19-Feb-19
Mini Metro,"I love the mechanics. Very fun, fluid and a great variation of landscapes and challenges. Only issue is that every level is effectively an 'endless' scenario.

Poppy Playtime Chapter 1,Runs surprisingly well on a Samsung Galaxy A21 a lot better than some other games I've played there is just a couple of things I would love to see implemented the first thing of choice of text sizes as the current text in game is extremely small and the other for puzzles that involve moving scenery I would like the option to drag finger to slide the scenery this would use your free hand because the reticle can be finicky and I find it tricky to get the motions correct without falling off grates.,POSITIVE,0,0.980647743,26-Feb-22

They sprint behind your vehicle, and can sprint faster than you can move so you can't outrun them. They then grab onto your vehicle and make it difficult to move. It's as though each one weighs only a little less than your vehicle because they cripple speed and your ability to smash through objects. They completely ruined the game for me.",NEGATIVE,1,0.998920321,14-Oct-19

Every level CAN be beaten with no micro-transactions. It feels extremely rewarding to finally find the right combo of towers to breeze through a level. Easily my favorite series tower defense games.,POSITIVE,0,0.998661637,12-Feb-22
Kingdom Rush Frontiers TD,"Great game! All of them are! There is only one thing I'm asking for though, which obviously doesn't have to be put in, but just a suggestion. Could you perhaps make it like the pc version with the vignettes on the loading screen for levels and the coloured map? Just for some extra lovely scenery. The game is still absolutely awesome. I'm making it my quest to have every single level perfect.",POSITIVE,0,0.999849677,15-Dec-19
Kingdom Rush Frontiers TD,"It's a fun game, as is expected from a Kingdom Rush game. However, there is a dramatic difficulty curve (more like wall) that happens a few levels in, making it hard for F2P players to progress even on Normal difficulty. While it's good for the nostalgia, it's probably better to just download the free version and vibe with that. The last level is particularly difficult with the enemy completely destroying your towers constantly versus just temporarily putting them out of commission.",NEGATIVE,1,0.988414168,5-May-22

Kingdom Rush Frontiers TD,"Awesome tower defense game. I've beaten every level without paying a dime. I don't see any ads. The game itself is highly engaging - strategic, replayable, lots of variety. No tower is too powerful (the game isn't  broken  is how game designers say it, the mechanics work). It's just a very well put together game. There are times when a  speed up  button would be nice, but I also learn what works and doesn't by paying attention. Anyway, get it. Great fun if you like the type!",POSITIVE,0,0.999408364,10-Jan-21
Kingdom Rush Frontiers TD,"The Kingdom Rush games are always fantastic and well worth the few dollars to buy the base game. The best part is that the game is perfectly playable without paying for anything beyond the initial cost.

Some of the maps are a bit too busy for me (particularly near the end, where enemy synergies can leave you feeling pretty cheated) and there are a few points where the difficulty spike will have you reaching for items to have any chance of three-starring the maps.

AI seems to roll doubles consistently whilst I (user) do not so board gets purchased quickly leaving you behind. Feels rigged. You're unable to exit out of the app and come back into the game.

Unfortunately, World #3, Level X is currently broken for me (Love Letters) - at about 19%-20%, when the screen flashes and the base kicks in, instead of proceeding with the beat, the spheres stay in one place and on the next beat you lose. I've tried this level about 20 times and I'm pretty sure it's a bug (Samsung S7 with Android 8.0 and build 1.0.5 ~ r15). Please fix this!",NEGATIVE,1,0.994091213,15-Feb-19
A Dance of Fire and Ice,"Easy to pick up hard to master, after being tired of the top rhythm game charts being filled with nothing but clones of the same 3 games it's refreshing to have something actually engaging which doesn't bombard you with advertising every 30 or so seconds. I reccomend this to anyone who considers themselves a fan of rhythm games, if they have somehow not heard of it already.",POSITIVE,0,0.998763323,8-Aug-20
A Dance of Fire and Ice,"8 hours deep now and I love the pain! Stages 3 & 6 give a bad impression on the difficulty by being overly long and uninteresting musically, but 7-11 are some of the finest pieces of rhythm gaming I've played in years. The jazzier, off-tempo instrumentals lend themselves really well to the tile-based system, with the bass drum on later electronic tracks driving behind every note tapped. It really builds into a fantastic game. Don't let 6-X ruin that!",POSITIVE,0,0.999612153,14-Mar-21
A Dance of Fire and Ice,"So fun, this game is worth it. A cool extra i found is, while you are picking your color (start screen then go left) is keep on switching your color on and on then if you do it correctly you can see the color of the ball switching and switching!",POSITIVE,0,0.999841213,10-Apr-24
A Dance of Fire and Ice,Great game. Really refreshing to see a game that has basically no issues and has consistent gameplay. It would be a 5 star if there were more levels. If you've played rythm games before you'll probably beat most of the levels fairly quickly.,POSITIVE,0,0.999751985,29-Apr-24

A Dance of Fire and Ice,"A lovely game, relaxing at first but it gets soo much harder later on. A lot of people who play this also play geometry dash so on a scale of 1-10: 1 being stereo madness and 10 being clubstep, the game rates at a 1 leveling up towards a jolly 8 quickly.

A Dance of Fire and Ice,Fun but quite challenging! The music bops and I love the design of the note track where the direction changes when you go from 1/4 notes to 1/8 notes for example.

The first 5 worlds are quite fun and have just the right amount of challenge, and the extra's level was extremely difficult but had checkpoints every 15-25%, which was extremely nice! And then world 6 happened. I have over 50 tries on world 6 alone, and I'm not even past 30% done with the final level of that. What ever happened to the steady difficulty curve?

A Dance of Fire and Ice,"When I first learnt about this game on mobile, I thought it was very fun and nothing could beat this. Although, once I saw how good the original PC version of ADOFAI was, this game felt like nothing compared to what it could be. If the devs added everything that was on PC, the game would be much better. Kind of like GD, where everything is shared.

I purchase this game and the dlc and i never regret buying it. i hope in more update and more world because i just beat all levels in this game. totally worth it and you should try it if you are a rhythm game person. 5 star for me and plss, add the creator level like the steam. thank you!!",POSITIVE,0,0.999819577,15-Dec-23
A Dance of Fire and Ice,The game is satisfying...as long as your perfect. The BIGGEST flaw with this game is that you CAN'T finish or practice the song unless you get EVERYTHING PERFECT. The fact that you cam even hear the whole song to get down the rhythms until you look up the song on YouTube is a FLAW in this game. Not worth the money for all the infuriating amount of times that you have to re-do a level.,NEGATIVE,1,0.991482735,28-Aug-22

Playing at ascension 11 but I don't have access to the Foreign Influence card. I think the UI could also be improved. I am constantly accidentally playing cards. If I select a card, then try to use a potion it often decides to play the card. It's a bit finicky to use and can damage runs.

Slay the Spire,"The game itself is absolutely brilliant - I've played it on several other platforms and having a mobile version is getting me hooked all over again. Unfortunately it's beset by technical problems: it crashes constantly, on average once every run, and it takes an arbitrary amount of time for successful ascension runs to register, giving the impression that your hard-fought victories counted for nothing.

Slay the Spire,"Great game, I have hundreds of hours on PC but I'm really disappointed at the experience on mobile. UI is identical to PC and it doesn't function well with a touch screen interface on my admittedly small phone screen.

Only two things that keep it from being a 5 star. 1) The ability to drag a symbol onto an existing beat; cancelling it and prepping it for the next one.

As the app syncs the individual beats on their own giving you a set beat and tone, so the mixing can be at times very limited. I also hope there are more updates and different beat mixes, this app has alot of potential to be amazing.

All levels take place in same map, for more than 30 missions with little variation or creative kills. No story or lore. Most guns unlockible and upgradible through play. Have visual variations and different perks. But barely effect gameplay. In-game purchases are an insult But Deathvalley is fun and can get intense, with guns and upgrades mattering.

Hitman Sniper,"I don't know who wrote these reviews, but this game isn't as good as people think. Yeah sure the customization on the sniper rifles are awesome, but I'm past rank 3 already with a few missions done and the only map you get is the mansion. It's repetitive and annoying as a normal sniper game. Concerning a  Hitman  game, this is not anything like a Hitman game. There is no walking around. There is no stealth sneaking and hiding until the enemy stops looking for you. There are no stealth kills with blunt or sharp objects. All you do is stand in one position like a scarecrow on every map and just shoot the enemies that have a repetitive movement. Sure they are on patrol, but the don't even step out of the line that you set for them to follow. Calling this a  Hitman  game is an insult to the genre of games and to the name Hitman. This... this is just a normal sniper game that you can literally get from any game designer that specialize in these types of games. The only good thing about it, is that you get to upgrade a bunch of different sniper rifles. Even the enemies you use, keep appearing in later missions. I mean it's one thing to have an enemy on one mission and having to redo that specific mission over and over to get the part you're looking for, but it's another thing entirely if you have the same name enemy that looks exactly the same as the one you killed a few missions ago appear in later missions. Phones are strong enough so that you can play the first Hitman game and not even that is shown lately. Most new phones have the capabilities to run something like that. Variety is needed. More maps to cycle through randomly... the ability to do what you do in normal Hitman games, even if you need to make it a game you view the map and your character from the top.

I find it a fun time, but keep these in mind when playing.",POSITIVE,0,0.816922843,8-Oct-21
Hitman Sniper,"Overall it's a good game, but when you alert them because for some reason it glitches and they become invincible you are like  okay, I guess I'll just kill the target  but then it zooms you across the map to a random guy.

It is simply incompetent that they never removed this over the course of multiple years.",POSITIVE,0,0.972347498,7-Apr-19
Hitman Sniper,"Decent gameplay but too repetitive; you're on the same map over and over with exactly the same npc behaviour each time, all that changes is the single sub-objective you're trying to complete like get 3 headshots in a row. Gun-unlocking becomes a tedious grind very fast. Gameplay wise, it's reasonably smooth but could use improvements, it often lags a fraction when you shoot at a moving target, making you miss those headshots.",NEGATIVE,1,0.998148561,24-Nov-18
Hitman Sniper,"The weapon mechanics are fantastic and figuring out how to complete missions is very fun. It seems silly to only have one map with nearly the exact same paths for all the targets and guards. The newer zombie mode is fun, but also falls prey to the same grindy, game prolonging mechanics that we see in the primary mode. Of course, there's no way that any huge updates will be coming to this game but some variety would rocket this app to 5 stars for nearly every reviewer.",NEGATIVE,1,0.858031452,8-Apr-19
Hitman Sniper,"Honestly? It's a hitman game. You have weapons to unlock, targets and mission objectives, a timer, and routines of npcs that you can learn with ease.

If you have an accidental touch or don't hit the fire button correctly, it'll pull you out of the zoom and swing the gun way away from where you were. You play the same locations over and over and over. You can't point the gun at something then zoom right in on it.

It doesnt change unless if updated at hollidays like Christmas.

For a paid game, it's surprising that it's completely bogged down with microtransactions, social media integration, and optional adverts.

The missions are shallow and usually consist of one-note  kill x  tasks. Compared to the wide sandbox of the Hitman games, and the sniper minigame of Hitman 2, this is seriously underwhelming.

That's only one thing I hate about this game if you can call it that...its the same map throughout the entire thing and killing the same enemies which only change position sometimes. You get bombarded with ads in a paid for app!! You also get bombarded with microtransactions and offers to buy new weapons and parts with special abilities not worth anything. There's a zombie map which was fun at first but got so repetitive quickly. Calling this hitman just seems like an insult to the series and fans. Stay away from this it also tends to slow down my phone drastically for some reason and I don't have a bad phone at all.

It does have is bugs and glitches, and some puzzles can be confusing, and many times I did need to use a walkthrough. But I feel that the few issues are made up for in story and visuals.

I do wish there are more chapters, because the replayability value is kind of low.

It took roughly 2 hours to complete 1 run but it also has somewhat of a replayable aspect, since you can switch perspectives it may take longer. For $3 it's very well made with a small but effective plot. The graphics of 2D and 3D was also interesting!

There are not enough words to explain my appreciation to something so creative, but I hope there will be many more to come soon. Thank you for a wonderful gaming opportunity.",POSITIVE,0,0.999870777,5-Jan-23

Never disappoint. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for this series. Not too difficult but not too easy either. Definitely eerie, not quite creepy, that fine line. I have no one to play with so I did it using my phone and tablet. So if anyone is curious, it works that way and was just as fun. 10/10, would recommend.",POSITIVE,0,0.99902904,25-May-23

I played it with my husband who has never played the Rusty Lake games and has no idea of their story, but he enjoyed the weirdness of this game and didn't feel confused by the story.

Look forward to the next!",POSITIVE,0,0.999760449,7-Nov-22

The Past Within,"I did enjoy it. I love the fact you need someone else to play with to progress thru the puzzles. Although... it is difficult to find someone that isn't expecting you to play through in one sitting or would accept playing over dm instead of the voice chat (some of us have kids and that makes that difficult!!) I can see that voice chat would be faster and more efficient, it's just not feasible for all. Good job Rusty Lake!! can't wait to try the other perspectives",NEGATIVE,1,0.998834193,15-Nov-22
The Past Within,"Just played with my sister and it took exactly 2 hours. Not as spooky as some of their other games, but still pretty spooky. The cooperative element was really interesting. It focused less on logic and story, and more on verbal communication. The art and music are as great as ever. The whole game is much simpler than many of their other titles, but I think if it was more complex many people would get frustrated. It would be cool to see this idea developed even further.",POSITIVE,0,0.997008145,5-Jan-23

I've been a fan since I found the cube escape games, I haven't played all of Rusty Lake's games but this one is amazing (heck maybe the best one I played so far)!

The Past Within,"Love the addition to the storyline but this was my least favourite of the series. I didn't love the co-op play but good did you for trying something different. There were no challenging puzzles. Everything was very straightforward. This was probably the 1st RL game that I didn't need to look at a walkthrough at some point. It was also quite short, finished in less than 90 minutes, despite there being a lot of downtime for the person working on the box. Looking forward to the next release.",NEGATIVE,1,0.992072284,5-Nov-22
The Past Within,"Just finished the game, and this is an insane addition to the lore in an incredible way. You can always count on Rusty Lake for a mind boggling twist and this might just be one of the best imo :D I LOVE the 3d and 2d element, they did a fantastic job of letting both the past and the future have a go with a room and a cube each. Props to Rusty Lake for experimenting and working with different styles of games, like this and the white door, while still keeping the Rusty Lake charm, V well done :D",POSITIVE,0,0.999831557,3-Nov-22
The Past Within,"We loved this game. I and my wife played this for almost 2 hours.. Extremely interesting and great concept of resurrection. However, I feel incomplete. Once you are done with the story, thats it, there is nothing more to it. We tried changing the roles but it's not the same as we know how to play now. I wish that the developers will add some more stoies in future update. I will recommend this game to my friends and family only if I see new stories in future update and increase the rating to 5â¨",POSITIVE,0,0.987401068,29-Jan-23
The Past Within,"Disappointed. I am a huge fan of Rusty Lake series, have played all their games incl White Door. This is the only one disappointed me. It's a co-operative game meaning that you have to purchase 2 copies, but the fun didn't double. It's not new for me as I played Tick Tock before, which also need to play w others. TPW's puzzles were too simple & gotta use the same device repeatedly just to get different tools, which was boring. The room is also quite small, I completed the game in about 1 hour.",NEGATIVE,1,0.999238372,3-Jan-23
The Past Within,"Wonderful game! Had so much fun playing it with my boyfriend. I really like the creepy vibe! After you pick a side and finish the game, you can play again on the other side with different puzzle solutions so you can experience both sides of the fun! It took us about 1,5 hours to finish the game, so it's a great bonding experience as well!",POSITIVE,0,0.999796331,9-Sep-23
The Past Within,I have been a big fan of Rusty Lake games for their unique aesthetic and this game is only the second mobile co-op one within this genre I have played (there should be more!). The additional 3d elements are refreshing but seem more like a gimmick which could have been traded for longer play time (my partner and I finished the game in 3 hours only). Still love the game and eagerly waiting for the next one from Rusty Lake.,POSITIVE,0,0.990245581,15-Nov-22
The Past Within,Absolutely loved this game ! The story was intriguing and the puzzles were interesting to solve. It also gave me a chance to spend time with my bestie as we had a  Long distance game night  There are 2 different modes giving the game a longer play time and opportunity to play as the other person! Looking forward to play more games by y'all. Kudos !,POSITIVE,0,0.999852061,7-Oct-23
The Past Within,I played this with a friend of mine and called through video chat and I love it! It's a wonderful challenge getting both sides to communicate what information is needed to solve the puzzle and the fact that both stories happen simultaneously is amazing! A lot of work has been put until this game and it's worth every penny! I've loved every single rusty lake game released and this one is by far my favourite so far. Great job!,POSITIVE,0,0.999855161,3-Nov-22
The Past Within,It was so worth the $3 it cost. Me and the person I played with thoroughly enjoyed the storyline and the length of the game. It was very interesting throughout the entire gameplay. 9/10 only because we wish it was a bit longer. Bravo.,POSITIVE,0,0.999592721,14-Apr-24
The Past Within,"Really great! My team played the  Butterfly  version. You should play Roots to get a better grasp of the plot and kind of feels like semi retcon of that end (maybe?), but this is a big step up in fun with the co-op element and feels like a classic escape room at its core. Surprising upgraded 3D cellshaded graphics in different parts of the game really elevate it. While not synced in any official manner through a server, playing with a partner truly feels connected.",POSITIVE,0,0.999433696,7-Oct-23
The Past Within,I played it with my brother today. It was great we both really like it and it's definitely worth the money. You can decide between a butterfly and a bee. I'm not quite sure if their puzzles are different but i think they're a bit different. You can also play it twice like one time in the past and one time in the future just to see what the other one sees. I think it's a great game so yeah much fun,POSITIVE,0,0.999841809,23-Dec-22
The Past Within,"This was great fun. You pick either the past or the future. Took us about 2/2.5 hours. And I can play as the future next time for a different experience, so seems well worth it. For the most part, the puzzles aren't v hard, it's more about the comms you have with the other player. Thanks Devs, great job!",POSITIVE,0,0.999783933,16-May-23
The Past Within,"I feel disappointed. The co-playing was a great experience. But in my opinion, paying 40 Kr for a game that took you more than 2 years to build, and had a play time of less than 1 hour was just too ... disappointing. The puzzles were not difficult, were pretty easy to solve together. I'm ambivalent about this ð",NEGATIVE,1,0.996291757,5-Nov-22
The Past Within,I played with myself on different devices. Rusty Lake games have always been my favourite and I look forward to the next game. I understand wanting to explore different dynamics of playing but I took off one star because not everyone has a trusted partner they can play with. And I don't want to play with a random stranger off Discord either.,NEGATIVE,1,0.98381424,13-Apr-23
The Past Within,"Such a fun game to play, it's developed very well with all its aspects, the graphics both in 2D and 3D are fantastic, the music hits the spot as always and the puzzles are very creative and fun to solve cooperatively.

The Past Within,Really enjoyed this co-op experience. Was interesting trying to explain to my partner what I had on my screen and try to link together.

Would love a single player version of additional story tied in to add something for a player to do while waiting for other person to be available.,POSITIVE,0,0.998096287,5-Nov-22
The Past Within,"Would have enjoyed a 1 player option. Too short, needed more chapters. But for $3 it was good fun. Now to play the other options and find all the quest achievements.

The Past Within,I have played the Rusty Lake series for a while now and to be able to play this with my friend was super cool and lots of fun!!

Reversing the roles with my friend now and playing again on the butterfly setting! Cant wait for the next one!,POSITIVE,0,0.999739587,22-Nov-22
The Past Within,"Escape rooms are expensive, it's hard to get a big enough group together to play one, and if it becomes too intense or you get stuck on something, then the whe experience goes sour. This game is an escape room, but so much better! It's only like $3, you only need one other person to play, and you can pause the game any time you want and get back to it later. Definitely a real treat. Thank you Rusty Lake!",POSITIVE,0,0.933162987,8-Mar-23

The Past Within,"It was pretty entertaining. Definitely get more out of it if you make sure you cannot see the other person's screen. Both experiences were fun and we spent a good amount of time playing. I'm always trying to find co-op games to play with my husband and we both enjoyed it. We both took turns playing the past and future. While we knew how to solve some of the puzzles, it was fun to let the other person figure it out again. Worth the purchase, I hope there are more co-op games to come. Thank you",POSITIVE,0,0.999836922,23-Nov-22
The Past Within,"I've been playing rusty lake's games from the beginning and waited a long time for this one in particular!!! and it totally worth it! It has the characteristic rusty lake's creepiness but amazing gaming style.

Great job! congratulations and thank you!",POSITIVE,0,0.999867201,11-Nov-22
The Past Within,"Absolutely love everything about this! What a great concept and the execution is perfect. I joked with my husband as we started playing that we needed Rusty Lake bingo cards and half-jokingly listed off a bunch of RL motifs and such. Every single one showed up at some point! ð¤£ Thanks for creating such a delightfully macabre and grotesque universe, and continuing to expand its depth.

I love RL games and will buy everything they put out.",POSITIVE,0,0.999651432,30-Nov-22
The Past Within,I was really disappointed. The idea is really good but its only 2 chapters & took us less than 2 hours to finish! I expected way more chapters & more complexity to the puzzles.

The Past Within,Very fun. had a blast with my friend. Discoverered a glitch but we swapped spots and were able to continue on.

The Past Within,"Really fun game, great puzzles!

The Past Within,Very well done was very fun and intriguing. I didn't have anyone to play with so I found someone off thier page on discord and it was an amazing experience.

I still don't know what is going on, but at least I'm able to put more pieces together. Not a big f6of multiplayer. So the replay value is low for me, which is just my personal preference and takes nothing away from the game. Great job Team Rusty Lake.",NEGATIVE,1,0.83408457,30-Jul-23

Little Nightmares,"Good: A+ for the backflips that you guys did to be able to port this IP. I assume it wasn't easy. Bad: Hard locking the game in a 16:9 aspect ratio is perhaps the laziest hack that the developers could've done. This is unforgivable and totally messes up the experience. Having it use a dynamic aspect ratio is really not that difficult, especially in Unreal.

But the big issue is the stripes, uglly,distracting & kills the imerssive experiance. atleast make 'em black, Game need to fit the whole sceen, Graphics take a nose dive. Interface's uglly.

Nonetheless, I don't know why we can't have dynamic shadows in a higher visual option. Second: the stripes on the side of the screen are awful. Why can't you guys support wider aspect ratios?

However, there is one thing that bothers me when playing this game, namely the frame on the left and right of the screen is very annoying, I ask the developer to maybe update in the future the frame is removed and the screen resolution can be increased. adjust to the size of the cellphone screen,,",NEGATIVE,1,0.996601582,14-Dec-23
Little Nightmares,"One of my favorite game series, always has been and this mobile port is amazing, graphics look amazing. the lack of a physical based lighting system is what really turns me off and ruins some immersion unfortunately.

Little Nightmares,"I'm glad it's on Android now, but it crashes in the beginning consecutively every time I try jumping up towards a lever after I've dodged some leeches. It needs a patch already. Otherwise besides that, it's a good game nonetheless, but really needs to be stable. Maybe add an autosave point after the first few leeches. I hate having to drag the chair over and over again.

All of that takes away from the great experience the game has to offer. Personally, I'm fine with the controls.

Little Nightmares,"(Ver. 104)Very disappointed port. I want to refund the game and buy original one on steam. Here's Why I disappointed. - User Interface(UI): Just plain texts and oil paint backgrounds makes it look like rip-off version of LN. - Graphics: Yes, I know. it for low-end devices but This using Unreal Engine 4 and nowadays we have snap 8 g 2 and 16 ram phone. The option is only low to high, No customable graphics. - Gameplay: 7/10 for keep original but choppy cutscenes and area that shouldn't have to.",NEGATIVE,1,0.999676228,13-Dec-23

Little Nightmares,Playing on a motoG 5G and this game runs like trash it lags almost constantly and the frame rate is so stuttery at times it's hard to even play and just isn't enjoyable and the controls are sluggish which could be from the lag or frame rate issues.

I was also denied a refund for some reason from Google play.,NEGATIVE,1,0.999817908,7-Mar-24
Little Nightmares,I'll start off by saying that this is a great game despite me rating it the way I did. I already own it on PC & Switch and have beaten it many times since I first got it. My only gripe with this port is the performance. I will admit that the dev team put a lot of effort into it and it shows as I'm surprised to even see such a UE4 game running on mobile devices. Seeing it run so poorly on my Huawei Nova 5T on low settings with 30FPS is such a bummer though. I will not refund it but await a fix.,NEGATIVE,1,0.978945434,13-Dec-23

This would not be an issue but I contacted the developers through their email and a bot replied and said they will answer when they can. It has been nearly a month with no reply and no updates to support my device.

I appreciated the slimmed down version for the mobile platform and it has plenty of potential, but it's just far too buggy. I'm 12 hours of gameplay in now and I can't play for 5 minutes without it freezing. This had been happening at the start but gets more and more frequent the longer you play.

I get that it's new, but the flickering graphics are annoying to say the least. Also, why is there not an option for a bale spike. I like the auto-load trailers, but sometimes you can't get into a loading spot like on the European styled farm.

Farming Simulator 23 Mobile,"It's good but it still needs work to catch up to previous games. For one it needs multi-player.

Furthermore, there's no option to manually upload to the cloud like I remember in earlier games, and the save always says 'not uploaded.'

Overall, the game is really good and absolutely stunning in detail.

Lately however, it seems like there's a bug in all of the games I have where it would display the full texture instead of have it confined to its shape.

I'd like to see an endless/super fast mode, where you get more (or endless) customers until you call it quits or get a bad score, or one where the difficulty was ramped up because of the speed at which the customers came in/expected things.

For example, the minigames with the tickets you get from tips. That was one of my favorite parts of the game. Another one that they took out is character creation.

All the sound effects and characters are the same, but the interface is different for mobile use, but it's easy to get used to. The only thing I don't like is that you can't redecorate the lobby, and after you've purchased all the extras, you don't have anything to do with your money.

Papa's Freezeria To Go!,"I overall love the game. One problem I have is the music. There should be an option to adjust the sound or turn only the music off in general; the music is louder and over powers the sound effects such as ringing, making it hard to hear when it's done mixing or a customer walks in. Also you should be able to decorate the shop where you want things to go and buy stuff for your character like playing on pc does. Adding those two will improve my experience SO MUCH.

Maybe because its one of the older ones. The newer ones are much more engaging. I'm not talking bad about this one but I just prefer the newer ones.

The Room,"This is a superb game. The puzzles are challenging but not impossible, while the hints give you just enough help if you need it. The graphics are very nice, although I sometimes find the scenes a bit under-lit. I have played the first three installments of the series on two different phones without experiencing any glitches. I've never paid for an android game, but I've decided the new episode of The Room is worth buying.",POSITIVE,0,0.999710739,20-May-22
The Room,Rating this one retroactively since I've since played the second game. This one is my favorite at the moment the puzzles were challenging but I never felt the need to use the clue function. I knew the answer was always right in front of me I just needed a change of perspective. In the second game the play area gets a fair bit bigger and it's a little easier to get lost but both are fantastic puzzle games.,POSITIVE,0,0.998925626,9-Mar-21
The Room,"For people who are looking for a clever but not pretentious puzzle game, I recommend this. There is a good narrative so it doesn't get bingey. The puzzles are sometimes hard, but always solveable and don't require any extra knowledge whatsoever. Graphics are neat and the whole design is just really good. The only problem I encountered was the touchscreen not reacting at some key puzzles, but it's probably caused by my laziness and infrequent wiping down of the screen :)",POSITIVE,0,0.711971045,3-Mar-20

The Room,"First things first: This isn't a long game. You can depending on how good you are at puzzles, you can expect to clear in a few hours. But those few hours are incredibly compelling. The game never holds your hand - even the hints only really point out things you might not necessarily have considered - and some of the puzzles do get quite tricky at times. But it is incredibly satisfying when you figure out the solution and things start falling into place.",POSITIVE,0,0.99947232,9-Nov-21

But I spent more time wrestling with the zoom and turn and select controls than what I did playing the game. It was awful. I'm not going to give it a horrible rating bc maybe I just suck, but I don't want to play a game that has me wanting to throw my phone into a lake.",NEGATIVE,1,0.999321938,8-Jan-23

The Room,"Played with my 5 year old, lots of fun! The puzzles are thought provoking but not frustrating, if you're stuck the hints feature definitely helps out without blatantly giving it away (until the last hint, but even then it doesn't tell you directly - more like a gentle handholding to solve it). At no point in time did we think or feel we were stuck, and he had a blast! Absolutely recommend if you enjoy head scratching puzzle games",POSITIVE,0,0.998470724,15-Feb-23
The Room,"One of the best puzzle games ever made period. The puzzles are well designed, made to actually challenge your mind and patience, but it's also more on the shorter side. Each level has you facing off sets of boxes with multiple mechanisms that can only be found by searching through the entire thing making sure to not miss any bits that might be helpful in solving the puzzle. The graphics are also stunning and sold on the game's premise itself. Highly recommend!",POSITIVE,0,0.999753535,11-Dec-22

And I felt like the word puzzles were disappointing. I kept looking for clues in the letters or in the table, and then it would turn out I was supposed to just use the lens and see some guy pointing to the answer. It's a well made game, but I found it more annoying to get through than fun.",NEGATIVE,1,0.999407411,13-Nov-21
The Room,"Beautifully made game. The mechanisms were superb to say the least. The hints system is spot-on. Most of the time you won't need hints, but a little push is all it takes. It got me wanting to play it everytime I had a break. The only downside is that it is too short, man. I literally bought it yesterday; I didn't even play it all day.

The hints are helpful and if you find yourself frustrated with the hints or gameplay, take another look at *everything*. If the game won't let you look closer at something, it's not relevant; if it won't let you put an item somewhere, it doesn't go there.

The Room,I as an adult absolutely love this one and the other ls. 4 total that I've found and owned. I would not consider this a kids game. The deeper you get into the story the more adult creep factor it gives. My niece is 7 and she fears this game. Id rate it at least 13 and up. It has a skeleton in a level. It mentions death through all the chapters.. Still amazingly challenging and fun! I hope they have more soon! FYI: Try dragging not tapping when it's not working ð¥¶,POSITIVE,0,0.997639894,8-Feb-24
The Room,Wow! Is all i can say! This game was exactly what i was looking for. Something to help pass time not boring or repetative with a story line that makes me use my brain! Kept me intrigued til the very end! Im omw to buy the room two right now but figured id leave my opinions so others can see. Great graphics and sound makes it creepily interesting its very neat.

The Room,"Very well done visually and in terms of atmosphere. Most puzzles are fairly straightforward, some required use of hints (some aren't very apparent).

The Room,"Thought the game had great atmosphere, enjoyed the little hints of story littered throughout, but I personally found it a little too easy and way too short. Considering it was only $1, that's not that bad. However, I feel since this is the first in a series, it should have been free as a better hook. Now I'm just nervous about buying the others. The prices only increase and I have no way of knowing if the game length increases with it. $5 for the same game length would be much too expensive.",NEGATIVE,1,0.99884522,3-Dec-21
The Room, The Room  is absolutely one of the best puzzle games ever. Albeit it has it's own weak spots. Amongst them is having excessive chest puzzles and less various riddles; unlike the Room two that has more liberal environment and variegated mystries.

Amazing immersive experience from the visuals to the sound design. Did it in all up a couple hours, with break in between to let mind rest. Don't use the hints and spoil for yourself, just observe how each box, mechanism, machine operates and you'll get it. There is a simple story but I assume it goes into more detail in future games.

The puzzle that required tilting the phone threw me off bc i wasn't expecting to have to do that (and i don't really like to have to do that either).

It's atmosphere if it doesn't bother you. Turn down the volume if it does although you may miss some sound clues. What I truly love is the clues are there for you if you need them or you can ignore them. But I love that they are just there. Some people want to be hand held, others scour every inch before resorting to the clues. Puzzles are clever and challenging. Thoroughly enjoyable game with no ads! Yay!",POSITIVE,0,0.994841516,15-Sep-18

During this bug you can still wind up the music box and change cams but you just can't pull the moniter down when it gets stuck in this state.

In the first FNAF game, you held on your screen to turn, but instead on this one, you instantly go to the left/right when you tap, giving it a hard time to actually see in the middle hallway. The other thing that bugs me, is that you have to be very quick to put on your mask for the withered animatronics. Other than that, it's a really fun game.",POSITIVE,0,0.987834871,25-Nov-19

There is a little lag and when I put on the mask there is a delay making Old Chica and Old bonnie jumpscare you even when you put on the mask quick. And the music box on night 6 is so dumb because you have to wind it up everytime. The music box is wound down leaving the puppet to instantly come without stopping it.

If you have a PC, just get it on there. It's free on there! And it's on Steam! Don't get me wrong, this is an awesome game, but it just needs to be free.

Ultimate Custom Night,"All in all, a great port of UCN to mobile. A fun timewaster of a game that runs well and looks good. It loses points, however, for failing to play certain sound cues which often leads to player failure. Which in a game which is all about listening out for those sound cues is not ideal.

Ultimate Custom Night,"This port is really nice! There are some bugs that need fixing however, and a big one is that certain characters don't make noises upon arrival. For example- Ballora doesn't play her music at all when she gets closer to the doors, and I don't know why that happens, because it's apart of her gimmick to play music. Another thing is that if I lose in a specific Challenge, and I want to play that one again, I have to reset the app to try again, as accesing it in the menu doesn't work after death.",NEGATIVE,1,0.992105365,22-May-20

The gameplay is a near perfect copy of the original version, the only difference being, of course, the fact that you don't have a keyboard and thus you need to click everything onscreen, making nightmare puppet more dangerous. Two issues, though. First, even with quality over performance being removed, the game seems to be unable to smoothly transition into the jumpscare animations. Also, some of the buttons are rather small and hard to click. :)",NEGATIVE,1,0.999495268,29-Jun-20
Ultimate Custom Night,Just like the original! Though there is a couple issues. One issue is that when you catch a fish from old man consequences the left door registers the tap and closes the door when that's not the case. Also the buttons are a bit too tiny.

The flashlight is in a hard place to press, it takes many taps to move the floor sign, and on the home screen when you click 'special' and then any of the 3 buttons, most of the time it will glitch out and you have to back space to get out of it.

When doing challenges, sometimes the menu pops up when exiting a level, forcing you to choose another challenge, and then your original challenge again. Also sometimes lefty doesn't spawn on cams until later, which I don't really know if that's on purpose or not. Also cheats should be free, or at least cheaper, I think after spending what I did for a game I could have gotten for free on pc, cheats should be free/inexpensive",NEGATIVE,1,0.99820435,21-Jan-22

Performance issue, I have a Snapdragon 870 device which could run any other game fine at excellent settings but for some reason when Old Man Consequences appear or when theres multiple distractions at the office appearing at the same time, it just FPS drops HEAVILY and its sooo frustrating to deal with. I would be eternally grateful if this gets fixed. 8/10.",NEGATIVE,1,0.997351885,2-Aug-23

I understand that this is to stop op strategies, but if I'm winding the music box, I should also be able to catch a fish for old man consequences. 2. Some buttons are way to small. I'll use Toy Freddy as an example. Closing the door on toy Freddy's monitor is incredibly hard, especially if you need to do things quickly. There's more, but those are my main points.",NEGATIVE,1,0.838183045,25-Nov-20

What it can play and how well it plays is limited by the power of your hardware. I'm using this on a fairly high end Android TV box and it is working great. My Bluetooth controller was immediately mapped as I would want it. You can always remap buttons and sticks to your personal preference. This is certainly a 5 star app. If you find it less than a 5 star rating, your hardware is most likely not up to the task of proper PSP emulation. The application itself does an outstanding job.

Evertale,"Well it's overall a good game with good graphics and gives the feel of visual novel. Pretty good actually. If i have to describe this game in a nutshell, I'd say it's poekemon, finalfantasy tactics and your generic visual novel games mixed together into one. It's just that there's been a glitch that i got some soulstones from a quest and didn't receive it anywhere. Also you guys could maybe lower the price tags on purchaseables. In my opinion they are exceedingly high.",POSITIVE,0,0.999431074,1-May-21
Evertale,"The game mechanics have been stuck in a steady downward spiral for about the past year. The introduction of characters that are unkillable until their next turn and the constant sleeping of units has turned this into such an aggrevating slog it just isn't fun.

The game is horribly pay to win, every new character is made to be obscenely broken and very required to go anywhere in pvp. Once you finish the story pvp is the only thing left to do.

Evertale,"I took a break from playing and came back to see what's changed, only to find that the game is an unbalanced mess. New characters completely disregard previously established game mechanics, and every new character that is released changes the meta in a way that most characters become useless a few months after they're released. After Act 1, multiplayer is the game's main draw, but with the powercreep of new units, multiplayer isn't fun or sustainable unless you spend an obscene amount of money.",NEGATIVE,1,0.999807894,31-Jan-24
Evertale,"The Story is unique which is great, but hasn'tbeen updated in a while. New content and fixes are lacking whether you're F2P or paid. There's not much incentive for new players to join. The game is beautiful artwork and environment wise and the turn based fighting style is nostalgic. If a system for excess equipment/characters/and shards isn't implemented then the player base will continue to dwindle. Otherwise, majority of players I see will stick to being casual and eventually leave the game.",NEGATIVE,1,0.994295299,6-Mar-24

Evertale,"From what I know of Evertale, its ads are unique and have been theorized to be some scheme undercover. Time alterations and looped demise. It's nice overall, doesn't have extremely overpowered normal attacks for the main character, but provides seriously addictive win-lose situations that I like.

Evertale,"In the time I cleared chapter 1 I had cleared 4 chapters for another game of the same genre and business model. For when I got enough for my first unpaid 10x, I had pulled multiple featured SSR in another game just for creating the account. Basically, Evertale doesn't keep up with other games, it's a phone game, you might wanna step up the quick rewarding and being more generous, change all of the x20 rewards into x100 and do the same for all the others, multiply them by 5. Then I'd play.",NEGATIVE,1,0.994439721,6-Apr-24
Evertale,"So for the main storyline itself it's worth the the price. However the online story and online mode is different so you should know what you're getting into. Online story has no voice acting but it's still engaging and the rewards are worth it. Online PvP is definitely pay to win. However, they are pretty generous with their soul gems and if you're patient you can get the meta units. As for storytelling goes it's not too bad. Some event stories are really interesting. Give the game a try!",POSITIVE,0,0.999776781,12-Apr-24

Once you finish the single player part you will get stomped by people who spend hundreds, sometimes thousands for their characters and you will have no chance unless you spend that much as well.

Evertale,"Characters all have a valid end goal and very relatable, stories executed kinda well, I can at least get a solid imagery. The gameplay is kinda complicated at first to understand, it takes time before you get used to the mechanics, almost took me a full hour to get through the full chapter, so that explains my point.

Evertale,"It's really fun, and tbh, I don't see many problems with it. You can definitely play this without paying. However, the only issue I have is that the story mode hasn't gotten an update in a while. It's the main part of the game, and there really isn't a lot to do besides it.

Beyond the low-tier rubbish every 'monster' is a pornographic anime girl). Objectively: Both games are good enough at what they are, thus the 3â (I did, actually, pay and nerd out on both) Subjectively: the marketing is willfully underhanded.

I don't like it's gatcha though. the cash shop is overpriced, very little in bonus rewards, and drop rates on banner summons is pretty low for how hard summon resources are to get. That said, you don't need the rarest characters to clear content, and it doesn't have the waifu appeal like azur lane etc anyway, so if it's just the game you care about, definitely give this one a try.",POSITIVE,0,0.884978831,7-Feb-24
Evertale,"TLDR - Don't get this game. I'd gotten the game when it was briefly free (to download, anyway). The story...is okay; I've seen worse, at least. It was rough just to pull even an  SR  character within the first week without needing to BUY the in-game currency for wishing; in fact, the game highly encourages new players to pull out their credit cards for them! Don't even get me STARTED on the  pity  system to get an  SSR character.  500 pulls?? Even Genshin Impact is more lenient with just 90!",NEGATIVE,1,0.606352568,22-Feb-24
Evertale,After playing for almost 2 years. Game feels incomplete!!!a few months alot of people will quit your server. When cross server war comes there will be 1-2 alliances left in yours. Cross server will be fun for a few months but you start to get used to it and more people quit. Almost every server After even more months you will probably only have 1 alliance left. Which holds 50 people. Story has not be updated in over a year. Top tier characters you pull eventually weaken when new stuff comes out.,NEGATIVE,1,0.99954778,20-Mar-24
Evertale,This game needs some more advance animations and the offline story should have better animations and online story needs a freely moving system just like in offline story game is pretty good the long speeches should be shorten a bit and the system in which u can fight monsters in bushes should also be in online story the online story needs more work and also more new types of monsters should be added and many new characters and chatting system also needs a improvement and everything else is good,NEGATIVE,1,0.591830313,25-Feb-24
Evertale,"Updating my previous review to say that this game is no longer fun to play. All of the new characters are broken, SSR drop rates are the worst of any game, and the devs make no effort in correcting lack of balance in their game. I have spent more money on this game than it is worth and I have finally had enough of it. The devs need to start balancing their game and they need to do something about the drop rates.

Evertale,"Is there going to be a sequel to progress the story line? Or may be a spin off? I like the art style, the mechanics where you can catch a monster in the wild and add it to your ranks, i also like how you upgrade your items and your character, the randomness of the encounter as you go through the bushes, lore and world building can be improved though.

You can't even get the anniversary summons without PAYING for the soul stones or whatever they're called. There's also a lot of inappropriate imagery that is not safe for kids.

Evertale,"Maybe play it just for the story. I did like 100 gacha pulls and not a single super rare character, counting there are dozens of super rare but got none.

Evertale,"I have played this game for a long time before they even started extending the original story from offline to online. And I love the story. That's what attracted me at first. The combat system wasn't terrible, but it could've been upgraded countless times.

Two, there hasn't been any continuation about the online story which I am disappointed about because I've been waiting for a new one. Third is the gacha system is really scuffed sometimes, but that's how they work anyway so... Overall, I would always play this again because it always interests me.",POSITIVE,0,0.594157994,24-Dec-23

Evertale,Honestly enjoyed the offline story mode but it was too short. Online story mode feels really clunky. Character design is *chef's kiss* but it feels like everything is a cash grab.

Evertale,"Advertised as an RPG with monster capture, the game initially starts that way, but grows into a hero collector, where getting powerful heroes using the bad gacha system is required (though the game is reasonably generous in providing  soul stones  for summons), and doing daily chores (luckily not too time consuming) for resources needed for upgrades. Over time, the developers have made female characters more and more sexualised, with exaggerated bodies, little in the way of clothing and suggestive poses in their images, going as far as replacing original images which fitted the RPG much better. This has gotten to the point where I feel embarrassed playing this game in public. I still think it has some of the best writing for a hero collector and an enjoyable turn-based combat system with some tactical depth both on the battlefield and when it comes to party construction. Art is good too, even if, as mentioned, over-sexualised (even for underage characters). Unfortunately with no new chapters for a while and events repeating themselves (took about a year to happen), it's getting stale for me.

The rest of the game is stuck in auto mode. Like, you can't fight the tower or arena, you HAVE to auto it and AI is stupid.

My only complaint so far is that there are a lot of different resources and game modes that are available to new players, but they aren't well explained, nor delivered in a way that lets you intuitively progress through them.

It is lacking in some minor (and a little more than minor) features that'd really bring up the quality. 1) joystick-style movement. The map is too far zoomed in to be tap-to-moving all the time. 2) map of the local area (pop up, not necessarily a minimap). Right now, you have no idea where you're going (because the zoom is so high) and it feels more like wandering randomly than  exploring  3) Ability to switch field characters. Few people want to always be running around as Generic Chunibyo OC #3289. Its bad enough he has to be the story protagonist 4) a pokedex-esque index of monsters you've captured 5) summons are like 10 times more expensive than they should be.What did we learn from Anthem's failures?

It's set up for you to make draws on long-shot powerful characters to add to your team, but we're talking less than 2% success rate to get one of the two most powerful characters, so many players never get the most powerful ones the whole game. There are other ways to make your character more powerful, but they involve an insane amount of grinding. Here's the catch: you can way overpay to get more chances at the best characters, and it feels like everything is set up so that most players will eventually break down and buy chances instead of the incredible monotony of grinding.

Dynamic  show static pad , and  adjust with movement  in particular have allowed me to finish a few RPG's without having to lug around a controller with me. They really do make some of the games feel like mobile ports. Bravo. My only suggestion would be: -Dynamic adjust with movement: Allow changing of distance required before the dpad moves. Perhaps a slider in the options. Your finger has to travel quite a long distance before the dpad gets  dragged . Personally i'd prefer it if the distance required was a whole lot shorter (so that the dpad adjusts sooner). -CHD support. A lot of phones have limited space due to not supporting micro sd cards (practically all flagship phones dont have a slot). CHD is attractive for saving quite a whole bit of space.

I found these puzzles a bit easier (thank you), but still needed the walkthrough at times. XLNT work; job well done!",POSITIVE,0,0.99791342,14-Nov-19
Rusty Lake: Roots,What can i say. I am just sad i played this last from the whole series since i couldn't purchase it earlier. Incredible story and aesthetics making sense of the other installations lore. Very nice little puzzles especially the 1 with the pidgeons. Keep the good work guys and deliver more awesome and cool freaky stuff :D,POSITIVE,0,0.999405742,24-Jul-21
Rusty Lake: Roots,A good game overall. The puzzles are short and sweet which is nice but can feel unsatisfyingly short. The last few were quite buggy. The final puzzle gives you a hint after you've solved it (making it impossible to solve) so the ending is just frustrating.,NEGATIVE,1,0.9549281,12-Jul-21
Rusty Lake: Roots,"I love the Rusty Lake Saga, and Roots is no exception. Family history is well done and the story fits well with the puzzle aspect of the game.

Rusty Lake: Roots,"Probably my favorite game in the series. It's an excellent story, told in such a brilliantly subtle way that when the player figures out what's going on it's as though they're writing the story themselves.

Rusty Lake: Roots,"The worst of the all the rusty lake or cube escape games. I understand they tried to approach it differently, but introducing small stages is extremely unsatisfying.

Not really a word game at all but the use of letters is a fun and really clever touch.

I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 because the dimension of the moving pad isn't customizable, so the character often slams the ground when I don't want to because the pad is so small. All in all I recommend giving it a try.",POSITIVE,0,0.999497652,16-Mar-24
Dead Cells,"I have Dead Cells on both PlayStation and Mobile. Mobile is very true to the original. Love the gameplay but the controls are, being honest, not great. Some people might like the interact button, but I keep touching the actual portal or item instead of the button. Maybe add this as a new option? I also want to resize my movement joystick. It may seem small (pun int.), but I keep accidentally ground smashing.",NEGATIVE,1,0.994906485,7-Mar-24
Dead Cells,"The same Dead Cells experience one gets from PC. It's a few updates behind, but they seems to be rolling it out, albeit slowly. The touch controls are quite good but feels much better on a gamepad. Of course, it's unfair to compare the 2 and the touch controls are one of the better ones out there (Thank God for the static-dpad option. That was a make or break-it feature for me). A vibrate option would be cool. It always feels much better when it vibrates, lends the sense of an actual controller.",NEGATIVE,1,0.86383301,18-Feb-24
Dead Cells,"The game is well worth your money (the DLCs especially). I only have two complaints so far, the first is the joystick is only static and it would be nice if there's an option to make it dynamic as well. Secondly, the  Robin Hood  outfit has a rather pale green when you wear it compared to what is shown in the icon on your wiki and in the game. With that being said, the fact that these are my only complaints so far goes to show how competent and passionate the devs are. Best game purchase so far.",POSITIVE,0,0.989233017,14-Mar-24
Dead Cells,One key feature missing. There is no current way in the game to swap a/b x/y orientation so the game always will show the incorrect input. For example the game will prompt you to hit the bottom button but it actually is mapped to the right button. A simple option to reverse this would be greatly appreciated as remapping the buttons in game does not fix the problem,NEGATIVE,1,0.99673295,10-Mar-24
Dead Cells,"Use controller, touch control is really impossible to play. Gameplay really like when play on Steam. Framerate drastically drop where Masker take place, and will be much problem on higher difficulty. Another thing are bats problem, they can come across area even I don't see them and Kaboom!

Dead Cells,"Amazing !ð¯. When I could not understand it initially, the game grew on me with passage of time. The plot line is so top tier (that can be understood over the subsequent boss cells) and the graphics are pretty. Each biome run feels unique and I never get tired or bored of it. I wish developers add to the plot line further and introduce even more biomes with perhaps multiplayer runs, collaborations. It is such a beautiful game, and I don't want to ever give up on this* spoiler, helpless tragedy.",POSITIVE,0,0.999659181,10-Apr-24
Dead Cells,"I really enjoyed the came, but my main problem is that everytime I get to a new section of the game, it won't load and I have to delete the saved slot. When I start a new one, the thing finally loads, but then the next one after that won't load. And I keep seeing from others that this is being a common issue. That they get stuck at the loading screen forever, and I'm pretty tired of having to restart over and over due to this issue.",NEGATIVE,1,0.998864174,2-Feb-24
Dead Cells,Incredible Value. So many ways to play and levels and biomes. The best part is that you can adjust the difficulty so you can play and it's as challenging as you want it to be so you can progress and see the whole game. The controls on the phone are a little touchy especially around spiked traps but it's manageable. Great art and story and sound design. There are so many weapons and mutations and ways to play you could play probably forever. Worth every penny.,POSITIVE,0,0.999811828,18-Jan-24
Dead Cells,"Amazing, but there is a problem. I got the Play Pass and everything was fine, but it has become a monthly occurance.

At this poit it got annoying.",NEGATIVE,1,0.999054849,10-Apr-24
Dead Cells,"Excellent port, true to the original. A gamepad is a must, as the on-screen controls are not ideal. The game is very fluid and gamepad controls are highly responsive.

You won't be disappointed.",POSITIVE,0,0.999764025,2-Jan-24
Dead Cells,"It's annoyingly hard, but strangely addictively fun. The controls on Android are a touch finicky, unsure how they could fix it but movement is a little weird sometimes.

Dead Cells,"Dead Cells is a super-good roguelike that really rewards momentum in a lot of super compelling ways, and it works excellently with a controller like a Backbone or iPega Red Knight! ...thooough, a recent update (after 191) seems to make the SFX audio glitch and replay overtop of itself. It's especially jarring with crit sounds when you get 3 crits, and hear the noise 3 times, and then 3 times again in like, half a second when there's nothing around, so I'm dropping the review score a bit for now",POSITIVE,0,0.992722213,18-Jan-24
Dead Cells,"Masterpiece of an ARPG roguelike. It's levels struck the perfect balance of being compact and rewarding exploration, and so does the combat with fast paced simple item based attacks meets skill based dodging and/or blocking against various enemy attacks and behaviors.

Dead Cells,I purchased this game during the darkest phase of my life. I didn't play it after purchasing but I noticed it on my screen a couple of months after.

You did a great job at making this game and I hate to say it but I've been playing this game for over a year and I still have never beaten it.

Dead Cells,"Both my Ipega 9017S and Ipega PG-9023 have an oddly specific drift issue where the left thumbstick will drift to the left. However, instead of compensating for this by pressing right, if you press the left thumbstick LEFT, it will negate the drift. This seems like a software-side input issue, which is made worse by the fact that you can rebind all but the movement buttons on this game. The main menu tends to lag for some reason, in particular when going into the settings, a lag that I don't think repeats while heading into the settings in-game. Very odd. Otherwise, it's Dead Cells on mobile. It has autoattack, it runs pretty smooth aside of the above issue and controls about as crisp as you could expect for a game that requires tight controls yet is on mobile. Perhaps if the controller issue gets resolved I could tell you if the controller makes it crisp enough to enable reaction speeds that you'd require on PC.

I have the game on Steam, Xbox, and now Google Play, and love the ability to use one of my Bluetooth controllers to connect to my phone and play anywhere I like. Additionally, the app doesn't use excessive battery life, so I can get more wonderful hours of a game that's worth every cent.",POSITIVE,0,0.999730647,18-Sep-23

When I press jump, I suppose the hight of the jump varies according to the duration of the press but in reality, I tried standing still and just jumping the max height multiple times but it seems that the height is not constant.

Dead Cells,"Long time fan of the PC version and when I saw it came to mobile, straight up bought it. Was not disappointed! It's a few updates behind the PC version but that makes it even better imho. Controls were a bit hard to get used to, but they work flawlessly otherwise. I do get occasional crashes during loading screens on my Samsung A50 but no progress lost so far. Still deserves 5 star because I can see the devs are treating this mobile version like a younger sibling . Exceptional work! Keep it up!",POSITIVE,0,0.997988343,5-Jul-20
Dead Cells,"It's... A real game, for your phone. And a great one, at that. A roguelite spin on the  Metroidvania  style of games, with tough enemies, varied items, and a good bunch of persistent unlocks to keep you invested. All coupled with little lore pieces stashed around its maps to give you narrative motivation to progress. Controls could use a tiny bit of work - namely the touchpad is much too sensitive to vertical inputs - but it's otherwise fantastic!",POSITIVE,0,0.999568045,15-Jul-20
Dead Cells,"A very well made, rouge-like castlevania. I like the pixel graphics and the beautiful, fitting and unique music for every stage. I must say that I'm kinda addicted to the game, but I checked out the pc version too and saw that the mobile version is a lot behind the newer pc version. For example: There is no Vorpan. You can't get the pan from the merchant like in the pc/switch version. But overall this is one of my favourite games! Please consider updating the game.",POSITIVE,0,0.999451101,7-Jul-20
Dead Cells,"absolutely love dead cells, the only thing keeping it from 5 stars (specifically for mobile) is the atrocious touch controls. they're incredibly finicky and difficult to handle. why do i slam when im pulling the joystick up and pressing jump? the issue is especially prevalent when using the pure nail, since your attacks will always be up slashes unless you hold the stick at a perfect 90 degree angle. all you have to do is connect a controller and its an easy 5 star game",NEGATIVE,1,0.998504519,8-Apr-23

Only issues I have aside from a near constant crouch issue where even a tiny bit of having the dpad point down causes a crouch moment at odd times, only other one is if the Dead Cell DLC will e available or not for mobile at a later date, aside from that, perfect game on the go if you don't have a switch or switch lite.",POSITIVE,0,0.996009588,3-Jun-20

As it is, I have just recently decided to play the Android version again, and use Continue Mode to justify having spent the money on the game twice. It's still really fun, but I don't have the skill to beat it quickly, nor the time to play it often, and playing it natively beats streaming, even with a good connection.",POSITIVE,0,0.998352408,22-Sep-22

Dead Cells,Works surprisingly well with touch after a few runs. Few issues I had was mostly because of most inputs being relegated to the right side of the screen you tend to cover up that side with both the ui and your thumb. An opacity slider would be nice.

Dead Cells,Edit: The game runs perfectly fine now with no issue or crashing. Love this game so much and I play very often. I'm super excited for new content. Thank you for fixing my issue. Old review: Honestly the game is awesome and very fun and I want to play all the time....

Dead Cells,"Oh my, this game is A-MAY-ZING! For real, one of the few games which are an Android port from the PC which is also very well done AND an amazing game in itself. The OST is fitting and far from boring, the look is amazing and not that much of a downgrade from the original PC version and the controller support is very well done. The gameplay is intuitive and simple, yet challenging and exciting each run!

The touch controls aren't horrible, but do take a bit of getting used to, especially on a larger phone. However, as I said, connect a controller and it's just a fantastic game. Tons of progression, different layouts of levels every playthrough, a ridiculous selection of weapons and abilities, great combat and decent platforming, and the DLC adds a lot for being super cheap. 10/10 game in my opinion.",POSITIVE,0,0.999245524,28-Mar-23
Dead Cells,"Easily one of my favorite games on Steam. Bought it here instantly. While the $9 price may seem high, it is more than fair. This is one of the very few, high quality ports to mobile, with many hours of content, secrets, and near endless replayability. If I had one gripe, it would be the onscreen controls. In particular, it's way too easy to go into a crouch, which can make platforming sections difficult. Also, it would be super cool if I could sync over my progress from Steam.",POSITIVE,0,0.989180624,2-Jun-20
Dead Cells,"Pixel graphics, but doesn't feel like pixelated game. Animation is fluid and satisfying to watch. Battle is challenging, very challenging and fast paced. But it sure gets repetitive after some runs, and you need to unlock new boss cell to unlock higher difficulty by defeating last boss.

Dead Cells,"I haven't played Dead Cells on PC or anything, but the mobile controls are good enough that I don't feel like they are limiting my ability to play the game. Game is also great! Exactly what you think it is though, a rogue-like metroidvania platformer. If you know that isn't your cup of tea, this won't change your mind. If it is however, this is a perfect game for you.

I did find it annoying at first that there's no checkpoint, so you just go back to the first biome, but I actually like that now. The only annoying thing is the joystick control, which constantly registers me either going down or up, or not going down or up when I thought that I was practically horizontal/vertical, but that could just be me playing poorly.",POSITIVE,0,0.986447573,17-Sep-22
Dead Cells,"Every penny spent on this game is well worth it. The gameplay and story is highly engaging, it keeps you coming back for more. The feature that you go back to the start when you die reminds me of the Souls games, which is a good thing of course! It is hard without being too hard, keeps you on your toes because you know what is at stake if you die. Highly recommend it, as it also has excellent potential to go on the bigger screens of PS and PC, or other handheld consoles. Kudos to the developers!",POSITIVE,0,0.999866247,25-Oct-22

Very cool, loads of fun but very challenging and infuriating at times. If you need to adjust difficulty then look at assist mode for a more casual experience. Try playing with a controller.

The mobile version has a few small drawbacks- it is slightly behind the PC version in content.

I am currently having major issues with joining the game, so hopefully that is fixed soon.",NEGATIVE,1,0.985443532,4-Jan-23

Every like 5 to 10 seconds I'm crouching which is not ok. Almost every run that I went thru ended with me crouching and getting stabbed in the face or blown by a bomb or other projectile.

I would rate this 5 star if the developers would add a function to change controls. I have a Beitong (Betop) G2 and it lacks the buttons for a native controller support.

Dead Cells,"The game itself is truly fun. I've always wanted to play it on console, but sold mine before I could do so. My major gripe with it is touch controls should be as customizable as possible, and the fact you can't reconfigure fixed directional button makes it a lot harder to play for me. My phone has ultra wide screen, which means my left thumb takes a lot of the screen, and moving pad isn't ideal for me.

You can play it periodically, for extended sittings, etc. The game is adapted to be played at the user's convenience to a degree, meaning you're not penalized for not playing, you get offline stuff, and it's not overly complicated. The game can be played in a few different ways, and its fun to come back to, meaning you can try new strategies. You start over, but you keep certain quest rewards and you're rewarded with modifiers for all future runs.",POSITIVE,0,0.999424458,20-Aug-23
Magic Research,"I was a bit hesitant to grab this one. Incremental games are notorious for being microtransaction money pits. However, this game has none. The price tag to get it is the only time you'll pay. The progressions are very well paced and never leave you wishing you had the ability to buy into anything. The game includes a ton of story elements and branching options through each  prestige  keeping things fresh and exciting while still building off past accomplishments.",POSITIVE,0,0.994477868,1-Aug-23
Magic Research,"One of my favorite idle games I've played. It has an interesting storyline and mechanics that grow as you move through it. The upfront cost is well worth it compared to most that are thinly veiled ad watching simulators. It also doesn't try to be eternal, which is refreshing in this space. If you really want it to be, the options are there, but concluding it after one playthrough was satisfying for me.",POSITIVE,0,0.998314381,25-Jul-23
Magic Research,"I've played a lot of incremental idle games. And this has been my favorite so far. Mostly because there is a goal in the game, an endpoint. It may take a while to get to and you'll have to learn more mechanics as the game goes on. But it doesn't feel the same as something like adventure capitalist that just goes on endlessly with more wacky versions of the same. Also the moments where you have to actively play feel great as well. All around great game if you love idle games",POSITIVE,0,0.967465758,29-Sep-23
Magic Research,"Having now unlocked NG+, it is a good time to stop as I've gotten all achievements. It's pretty good. Some enemies in the late game are pretty annoying though, specifically the Trickster in the arena and the Charmer. Though for different reasons.

It's turned into easily one of my favorites, thank you! ð Cons: Elements need balance late game. Some are too weak due to cooldowns. Potions getting dispelled is a hassle. Melee/defense doesn't feel rewarding.",POSITIVE,0,0.988489687,17-Sep-23

Minecraft,"Minecraft is one of the most popular and well-known games in the world, and it's no surprise that the mobile version has become incredibly popular as well. The game is available for a wide range of platforms, including iOS and Android, making it accessible to a huge audience.

One of the things that makes Minecraft so appealing is its open-world sandbox gameplay, which gives players the freedom to explore, build, and create as they see fit. The game world is procedurally generated, meaning that each time you start a new game, you'll be presented with a unique and different environment. This creates a sense of exploration and discovery, as you never know what you'll find around the next corner.

The building aspect of Minecraft is also a major draw. Players can gather resources and use them to create structures, tools, and weapons. The game's block-based building system is intuitive and easy to pick up, making it accessible to players of all ages. Whether you're a seasoned builder or a complete novice, you'll be able to create some truly impressive structures.

Another great thing about Minecraft on mobile is that it supports cross-platform play with other versions of the game, so you can play with friends on other platforms, including PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. This means you can play with your friends no matter what device they are using.

One thing to note is that the mobile version of the game has some limitations compared to the PC version, but it still offers a great gaming experience. The graphics and overall performance are slightly less impressive, but the game is still highly enjoyable.

Overall, Minecraft for mobile is a great way to experience the game on-the-go. It offers the same open-world sandbox gameplay and building opportunities as the PC version, and it's accessible to a wide range of players. The cross-platform play feature is a great addition, and the game is highly enjoyable. The game does have some limitations compared to the PC version, but it still offers a great gaming experience for mobile players.",POSITIVE,0,0.999449909,14-Jan-23
Minecraft,"Minecraft is an extremely fun game to play with friends and family, its sparks creativity and I have been plays by it for years. Just $20 has changed my entire life, for the better. Here are reasons why you should download:
1.) Minecraft is a fun interactive game that is constantly changing, he w updates add more features and generally make the game more interesting and exciting, as of now (1.17) the added plenty of new features with huge plans in advance, I rate this feature 10/10.
2.) Minecraft is easy to play and connect with freinds, There is servers and every seed (world generation code thingy) changes the generation creating a unique experience for every server. I rate this 10/10
3.) Minecraft have many exciting mobs (or animals/monsters) to battle, farm, care for, etc. The vast majority of the game has exciting animals that each serve a purpose, weather it's trapping a friend or making new ones, the mobs play a role in an exciting experience. I rate this 9/10.
4.) Minecraft has several different blocks that serve not only an aesthetic pupose, but an important purpose in making a dream come true! I rate this 10/10.
5.) Minecraft has several different modes that your character can be on, these include, survival, creative, and adventure. Each of these creates an entirely different experience for the player and I will list each one of these below.
Creative: creative mode is a mode that makes you indestructible, and allows you to fly around, you have every block in the game accessible to you and you can spawn every animal/monster. You can also build as much as you want as you are not constrained by material limits. I rate this feature 10/10
Survival: this is the main game mode were you have health hunger and limited resources, this is best for survivalist and for people looking for an adventure! This is the main way to beat the game and gives you plenty of access to unlimited amounts of fun! I rate this feature 10/10.
Adventure: this is a masochistics dream, you can't build (unless on a special block called an allow block) or break anything, its perfect for playing maps (e.g. cube craft, mineplex, etc. etc...) You can make it so that people cannot destroy your builds and so you can make fun and interesting games. I rate this feature 9/10.
6.) Commands, Minecraft has a special block that allows you to write in a form of code and allows you to do stuff you normally wouldn't be able to do. I love using command blocks to make interesting features and there is SO much potential once you learn the fundamentals. To use command your going to need to go into the chat, and type / this will give you access to most of the commands, one command allows you to do all of the commands, type in the chat /give @s command_block 1. This will give you a command block giving you access to every single command.
7.) Preformance, Minecraft's performance is decent as long as you have a good device and internet, however there is one block that crashes your game when you have to much, that's tnt, you light it and you may not only blow up the area but your device. I rate the preformance 7/10.

Key: 1 updates, 2 world generation, 3 mobs, 4 blocks, 5 game modes, 6 commands, 7 performance. In total I rate this game 90 Kjillion Out of 10",POSITIVE,0,0.999554098,16-Jun-21

Minecraft,"All in all, there are plenty of possible IQ benefits to playing Minecraft, but here are some of the best that could be good for your kids brain. My kids are getting too much fun but of course they have some daily limits.

Minecraft is a game where players build structures and landscapes out of textured three dimensional cubes. There are two main modes:

Creative mode: In creative mode, you basically just build stuff. You can watch a sunrise over a blocky ocean that youâve created yourself. You can even fly.

This is the mode that you should encourage your children to use. In creative mode, players have unlimited resources and thereâs no monsters or threats to your life.

Survival mode: Survival mode is more like a standard video game. You collect food and resources and make your way through various landscapes. You get chased by nocturnal monsters (the game has its own timezone) and generally try to stay alive. When you die in  survival mode  you lose all your resources and have to start again. Any structures that you've built along the way, however, stay in place.

Then thereâs âmultiplayerâ: Different people have set up different games of Minecraft and when you play multiplayer you can join them. You just Google âMinecraft multiplayer URLsâ for a list, put in the URL that you want to join and start playing.

This means that your kids are online with strangers. I would not recommend letting your kids play multiplayer unless you apply either one of the following caveats:

Whitelisting: Your child or their friends can create their own multiplayer server and allow only people they know to play with them. It's a bit like a private Facebook page where you only 'friend' and share with people you actually know. When you create your own server you get the option to create a 'whitelist' â which is where you list all the usernames of the people who will be allowed to play on your multiplayer server.

You can create your own server on the Minecraft website. The option comes up when you hit 'download.'

Use a family-friendly server: Intercraften is a  family-friendly Minecraft server . They claim constant vigilance via the presence of an administrator and they apparently ban the IP addresses of people who do not comply with the Intercraften 'rules'.

I liken it to leaving your kids in the park with a trusted adult; if you trust Intercraften to be as vigilant as you would be ... go ahead.

But going back to the pros: Minecraft is cheap. About $30 gets you a login and all ongoing updates are free. You can buy one login and all your kids can play on it (just not at the same time, but they can take it in turns to play on the same login) So you get a lot of bang for your buck.

So whatâs the final verdict? Is it okay to let kids play Minecraft? Minecraft requires some basic maths skills to create structures and landscapes out of the three dimensional blocks so it's probably suitable for kids aged seven and up.

It provides the following benefits for children's learning:
- spatial awareness
- basic maths concepts
- creativity
- problem solving
- Still unsure about Minecraft?
- Think of it this way: Minecraft is like television or Facebook. Itâs okay as long as you:

Minecraft,"Minecraft is a game that involves immersing activities, but no real right or wrong way to play. Here, the world is made entirely out of blocks, giving the enviroment a playful and original look and functionality. You can build homes, farm crops, fight monsters, search for diamonds, climb mountains and the possibilities don't end there.
The player can create a world in one of two modes: survival mode or creative mode. Survival mode gives players limited health, animals and monsters to see, and resources to gather. In this mode, you must eat food or sleep in a bed to heal wounds and dying will allow you to respawn by a bed or your original spawn point. Despite the necessities of living, survival mode is by no means difficult, but rather fun and occupying. If this mode is hard for you, the options tab includes peaceful mode, which removes monsters from the game and health regenerates automatically. The other mode is creative mode. Creative simply allows you to use blocks from an a selection page and get straight into building without fear of danger of any kind. Creative mode gives players immunity from fall damage, lava, explosions; essentially every threat in the game. Finally, you can FLY in creative mode.
I currently own v. 0.5.0, so it's pretty up-to-date. Don't expect it to be anything like the PC or Xbox 360 Edition, because the features aren't quite that advanced. This app does have staples in the Minecraft universe such as creepers, diamonds and creative mode. However, Minecraft fanboys may be disappointed to
know that the latest features like enchanting, minecarts, brewing, dungeons, and the Nether don't make an appearance. In essence, the game is the barebones Minecraft experience with limitations like a smaller map and lack of mechanics.
Anyway, the game features no tutorial, so you will need to learn a lot of items and interactions by experimenting with them. Chances are that despite its flaws, this game is enjoyable provided you like building and exploring. If have a lot of creative ideas, this game allows you to build so many incredible structures and find interesting ways to bend the world around you.
Controls:
-tap the arrow keys in the bottom left to walk in the indicated direction.
-tap the center key to jump.
-tap and hold on a block to break it(this will allow you to collect certain resources).
-tap the panels on the hotbar to select items and blocks.
-the far right panel opens your inventory.
-from the inventory, tap  craft  to use the crafting menu.
-scroll through the crafting menu by swiping your thumb. tap an item or block to see what you need to craft it as well as what required components you already have. This is where you will find most of your essential information.
-tap the X to exit the menu.
-tap a panel in the inventory to bring it to the hotbar.
-tap a block to use it or place/use the currently held block/item on it.
-tap a monster/animal to hit it. Holding a sword, axe or pickaxe will do more damage.
- tap and hold on food items while you're holding them to eat them.
-In creative tap the center/jump button twice quickly to enter flight mode. Tap twice again to fall. Or while flying, tap jump and slide your finger up or down to rise or fall.
A few tips:
- monsters spawn in dark areas or a night. Try to get shelter before sunset.
-different tools can be made from different materials. Materials include wood, cobblestone, iron, gold, and diamond. Each of these have different strengths.
-sugarcane can only be found, grown, or placed by water.
-cook' beef, chicken, and pork in a furnace to make it better in quality. Also, be sure to refine iron/gold ore in a furnace before use.
-to farm, build a hoe and tap the ground to plash dirt or grass blocks. This will ocassionally drop seeds which can be put back in the soil to grow wheat.
-each monster has a different attack, and they also drop rare items. Learn about them.
-above all, have fun. That's the big point of the game!",NEGATIVE,1,0.694050908,19-Jan-13

This âfashionâ game is slow, boring, riddled with ads, and has no real object other than dressing a doll whoâs in underwear over and over and over again to see if you can dress âbetterâ than the bot doll.

Five Nights at Freddy's 3,"I actually liked this and found it to be an entertaining, well-spent game. However, if you do NOT enjoy scary games, or find discomfort whilst playing them, I do not recommend you buy this unless you are up to the challenge. For those of you posting reviews that this game is overly scary, you shouldn't have bought it despite the warnings, as this game was specifically designed to be scary. For those of you saying it's boring or not scary, you need to learn to appreciate a good game, as I've seen ones worse than this. As for the crashing, I'm not sure, but I haven't really had any problems with it so far, well, for me. This game could be easy or very difficult, depending on you. If it is easy, you can always do night 6 or see if you can do the custom night with all on extreme. If it's too hard, I recommend reading some of these tips.
TIPS: (If you don't want help, just ignore this..)
Bonnie The Rabbit-Night 1+: She/he?... is the most active animatronic of the game, mostly for earlier nights but throughout the entire game. (At least for me.) Bonnie can also disable the camera, during which can teleport, but Foxy can also move during this. Bonnie can only enter through your left door, so it's good to regularly check your left light. For me, cameras weren't that useful, as all I needed to check was my left light, but it's still good to know where they are. Bonnie can appear on any left-side camera except Foxy's one. Upon discovering Bonnie while checking your light, don't panic and immediately close your door. Bonnie has a longer reaction time and is generally quick to leave. If you see a shadow, Bonnie is still there. If you don't, I would open my door to conserve energy, but keep in mind Bonnie can show up anywhere at anytime.
Chica The Chicken-Night 1+: She is similar to Bonnie, but is still different. She isn't very active, more common on later nights. I don't often see her on Night 1, but it is still quite possible. Despite being less active, she commonly lingers by your door longer, draining your power. You can also check for her using your light, but if you see her and close your door, instead of a shadow you can see her through the window. She will enter through your right door instead of left. Her route she will follow will go from Show Stage Cam 1A to Dining Area Cam 1B to Restrooms Cam 7 to Kitchen Cam 6 to East Hall cameras 4A-4B, since only Bonnie can teleport. If you hear banging pots and pans in the kitchen, it's a sign Chica is there. She has a shorter reaction time than Bonnie, so be sure close the door quicker.
Foxy The Pirate-Night 2+: He is more unique from the others. He may seem inactive, but is a great threat. He is located in camera 1C, and starts out behind the curtains, but, with your camera, if you check him too little, he'll slowly come out. However, on later nights, if you check him too much, he will also start to come out. Perhaps check on him about every once every 3 times you open your camera. Well, it depends on how often you open your camera. This coming out has four stages. He begins with closed curtains, then peeks his head out, then appears to have his whole body out, then is completely gone, which is when the sign may change to  IT'S ME . Be more cautious after each stage, as it means he is closer to coming out. Should you check up on him and find the last stage, as fast as you can, DO NOT change cameras, close your camera and shut your left door, that's where he always enters from. Wait until you hear three knocks and three footsteps and open it. He has just sprinted through the hallway and took some of your power. The amount taken starts at 1% and increases by 5% each time, so try not to check him too much or little. He can also barge through your left door on Night 1 if you stand idle for a while or never check your camera. Otherwise, it's really rare.
Freddy the Bear-Night 4+: The main animatronic and a strong threat. On the first 2 nights, he will stay in the Show Stage, Cam 1A. On the 3rd night, he will wander. You may hear laughter and music from the kitchen, but he doesn't attack until night 4. He follows the same route Chica does, but rarely backtracks or wanders, unlike Chica or Bonnie. When you run out of power, Freddy will peek at you from the left door. You then have anywhere from about 15-50 seconds before death. Average is 32. There's nothing you can do during this but wait, but try not to move, as it may speed it up. Freddy enters from the right door, but like Foxy, checking your light won't help. Freddy also likes the dark, so he is hard to spot, but you may see white eyes. In the dining room, check for white eyes in the back. In the kitchen, listen for his music. (Not Foxy's singing, real music.) If you hear it, he's in the kitchen. He will laugh every time he moves. If he laughs and there is no music in the kitchen, check East Hall Corner. If he is there, immediately close your camera and shut the right door, and wait for two more laughs until you hear him retreating. It's good to keep an eye on him if you want to survive him. If you close both doors when not necessary, he can get you.
Golden Freddy: Like an Easter Egg of the game. In West Hall Corner, you may see him on any night, but most commonly the 1st or 3rd nights. Try to avoid checking this unless you really want to see him. If you do see him and close your camera, he will be in your room. After a few seconds, he will kill you and most likely crash your game. If you see him in your room, just put up your camera and he will disappear.
Just try to remain cool throughout gameplay, check your cameras, check your
lights, and only close your door if needed, opening up as soon as safe. I would only keep my cameras up a few seconds at a time, same with lights. Also, it helps to close your right door every time before checking your camera. (Freddy.) I myself use lights for Chica and Bonnie and cameras for Foxy and Freddy. If Chica or Bonnie sneak in, you will either die or they will disable the right or left doors and lights. It is worth the money if you enjoy it like I do.

Five Nights at Freddy's 3,"I got this one and the second one at the same time. I got one free, for the app of the day, and paid $5 usd for the other game-- not sure if i paid for this one or the 2nd one. NONE-THE LESS. i do not usually pay that much for a game. HOWEVER everyone was talking about the FIVE NIGHT OF FREDDYS and it was supposed to be such a great fun entertaining game... so i went ahead and downloaded the free one, and paid the five dollars for the second game. Completely disappointed. I do not understand the whole hype in this game series! I tried playing it over and over again, waiting for the excitement and trying to like the game, but it was so boring and completely pointless. Its not scary, its boring, there is no actual game play, your just looking at and switching between security  cameras   over and over again. I just do not understand what is so fun about this game. lol. It seems like most of the time, your just touching cameras and looking around. once in a while you see a doll out of place, or moved. thats it. I dont get it. Nothing exciting, nothing entertaining. I tried playing it over and over again, thinking maybe it gets better, maybe I am not playing this right. BUT, its just a very very pointless game. I dont no if i paid for the first freddys, or the second one, but which ever one, it was a waste. If it was free, i would not download it again. I downloaded it to my kindle fire hd, and it worked fine. BORING as ever, but it worked well on the kindle fire. It killed my battery, like you would not believe! I normally charge my kindle once every 3 or 4 days, and when i had these two Five nights at Freddys downloaded on my kindle, my battery would completely die within hours of just being on standby! I would not even be playing on it, it would have a full charge, and I would check it a few hours later, and it would be completely dead!  I thought something was wrong with my kindle battery, but than when i deleted and uninstalled the two Freddy games off my kindle, My battery started holding charge again and would stay charged for days on standby again. I seriously do not understand the hype in this game. and at five dollars--- this is unbelievably a waste! --- its so not even worth two quarters and a dime.",NEGATIVE,1,0.997914493,25-Jul-15

Five Nights at Freddy's 3,"The game is quite good, but it feels a bit bad on the visuals. This doesn't feel like it's made by the same person that made the og games. This feels more like a random person wanted to make fnaf 1 free on the fire tablet. It has the gameplay, but it feels like it needs more work on the looks.",NEGATIVE,1,0.999550998,16-Apr-24
Five Nights at Freddy's 3,I passed night 3 and was on night 4. But when I logged on the game I was still on night 3. Idk what happened but I'm quite angrey. Is it because I passed on night 3 when freddy was doing his jumpscare? I'm still a bit angry though because it took me 5 days to make it through night 3. I don't know if it just happened to me or not. No hate on the game though because I love it and play it everyday!,NEGATIVE,1,0.993572593,6-Feb-24
Five Nights at Freddy's 3,"Bonnie the Bunny- Bonnie comes out on all of the nights, including the first night. On the first night, the animatronics give you some time to get used to the game. Bonnie comes out from 2-4 in the morning. On later nights, 12 in the morning. He can disable the camera if you check it too much. Bonnie can also teleport, and can appear on any left-sided camera except Foxy's camera. If you searched every camera and Bonnie isn't there, check the left light. If he is there, do NOT hesitate, and immediately close the door. If you turn on the light, you can see a shadow through the door. If you turn on the light and you don't see a shadow, open the door to conserve energy.
Chica the Chicken- Chica can come out on any night at 4 in the morning, to 1 in the morning on later nights. She can appear on any right-sided camera except Foxy's camera. She will enter through the right door. If you turn on the right light and see her, close the door. She will take quicker to kill you, but lingers by the door longer, draining you power.
Foxy the Pirate- Foxy doesn't come out on the first night. He comes out only depending on how much you check your camera. On early nights (like the 2nd and 3rd), he comes out the less you check your camera. On later nights (like the 4th and 5th nights), he comes out the MORE you check your cameras. Here are the stages to avoid:
He starts out behind the curtains, then sticks his whole head out, then his whole body, and finally is gone, and the sign says, &#34;IT'S ME!&#34; When you see that, slam the left door down.
Freddy Fazbear- Freddy wanders on the third night, but doesn't attack until the fourth night. He likes the dark, so he will be hard to see. Also, listen for his music. Not Foxy. He also laughs every time he moves. If you see him in the East Hall, close the camera immediately and shut the right door.
Golden Freddy- Golden Freddy is also known as Yellow Bear. He is located in West Hall, and he spawns on the fifth night.",NEGATIVE,1,0.989162803,2-Apr-16
Five Nights at Freddy's 3,"this game is awesome but im stuck on night 6, TIPS: foxy can run to the left door so if the curtain is open then shut the left door. Sometime the doors and lights won't work but if your on night 1 or 2 just keep your camera up so they can't get you. Chicka is really slow and takes her time to get to the office and appears at theright window close the door. Check the lights before you open the door she takes about 16 seconds to leave.",NEGATIVE,1,0.996157825,1-Apr-24
